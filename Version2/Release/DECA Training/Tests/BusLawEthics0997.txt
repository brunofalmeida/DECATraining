Americans with Disabilities Act. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits businesses from
discriminating against disabled individuals who are qualified to do the job. In order to protect these
individuals, the ADA also regulates the type of questions that businesses may ask potential employees.
Businesses may not ask questions about medical histories, specific diseases, prescription drug usage,
treatment for mental health problems, etc. These are issues that businesses should not consider when
hiring employees. The Vocational Rehabilitation Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the National Labor
Relations Act do not prohibit businesses from asking potential employees about their medical history.

Open corporations. Individuals who invest their money in an open, or public, corporation are known as
stockholders, or shareholders, because what they actually purchase are shares of stock in the corporation.
This gives the investors the opportunity to share in the growth and possible profits of the corporation.
General partnerships are owned by two or more partners. A close corporation is owned by a few people and
does not offer its shares for sale to the general public. A sole proprietorship is owned by one person.

Order and protection. Laws are rules that govern a person's behavior. A person who is caught breaking a
law can be subject to punishment (e.g., fine, employment dismissal, prison sentence). The purpose of a law
is to create order within a group or society, maintain a sense of fairness or equity among people, and
protect people from the wrongful acts of others by providing security. Without laws, some people might
behave in dangerous or unethical ways. Consistent regulations and legal boundaries do not provide society
with uniqueness. Lawlessness can create chaos, turmoil, and inequitable treatment of others.

Civilized nations. General principles of law are the guidelines that the majority of humans embrace and live
by in terms of right and wrong behavior. These guidelines originate from civilized (enlightened or evolved)
countries whose citizens value life and care for the environment. Many third­world countries are civilized but
lack economic stability and do not have a strong infrastructure to support their people. Some civilized
nations are governed by socialist governments and governments with specific political views, but not all of
them are.

Believes his/her rights have been violated. A civil lawsuit is a personal complaint in which one party believes
that another party has violated his/her rights by acting in a negligent way. For example, a person who is
injured in an accident might file a lawsuit against the person who caused the accident. A statutory law is a
written regulation that is approved by a governing body. When a person breaks his/her own code of ethics,
s/he doesn't necessarily file a civil lawsuit against someone else. An appeal is an action in which a
defendant requests that another court review a previous court's decision as it relates to his/her case.

File an appeal with a higher court. If one party disagrees with a court's decision (judgment), the party can
file an appeal with a higher (appellate) court. An appeal is a request to review the lower court's decision to
determine if procedural errors were made. An appellate court can overturn a lower court's decision. A
country's Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, but it does not automatically review all cases that
seek its intervention. If a judge declares a mistrial during the trial process, the case will likely be retried at
the same court level. Mediation is an attempt to resolve a dispute through an independent, neutral third
party rather than through the court system.

The U.S. federal court district hears cases in which the United States is a party. In the United States, there
are courts at many levels of government (e.g., local, state, federal). Jurisdiction refers to the authority that
each court level has to make decisions about disputes (e.g., subject matter, location). The U.S. federal court
district is limited to hearing cases that involve a federal question, the diversity of citizenship, or those in
which the U.S. is a party (e.g., defendant, plaintiff). Personal injury cases are heard in the U.S. federal court

Compensatory. Compensatory damages are payments that the court orders a wrongdoer to pay to a victim.
Examples of compensatory damages are medical expenses, lost wages, loss of property, etc. Punitive
damages are financial awards that go above and beyond compensatory damages and serve as a way of
punishing the wrongdoer. Consequential damages are financial payments that the court orders a wrongdoer
to pay to a victim, which is not awarded as an immediate result of the wrongdoing, but as an indirect
consequence of the wrongdoer's actions. Aggregate is a fictitious term to describe types of damages.

Embezzlement. A crime is a wrongdoing against society. An action is defined as a crime by determining if it
violates a law and by examining the offender's intent. Embezzlement is the fraudulent use of another
person's or a business's property, usually money. For example, if an employee steals or misallocates funds
from his/her employer, it is embezzlement. Embezzlement is a crime because it breaks a law and it is an
intentional act. Defamation, unintentional negligence, and breach of contract are concepts associated with
tort law rather than crimes.

11. D
Responsible behavior. Under common law, individuals and businesses are expected to exhibit responsible
behavior—this is referred to as the duty of being reasonable. When businesses do not take steps to make
their environments safe, they are behaving in a negligent, irresponsible manner. Businesses that exhibit
imprecise actions, indifferent attitudes, or defensive conduct may be acting in a negligent manner. These
are violations of civic duty.

Reputation. Reputation is the way a business's customers, shareholders, vendors, and community view it in
terms of image and integrity. When a business is a defendant in a legal action, information might reveal that
the business behaved in an illegal or unethical way. As a result, the business might lose its credibility with
its public, which can negatively impact its reputation. Social responsibility refers to a business's role and the
attitude it has for the well­being of society and the physical environment. Attributes are the physical
characteristics of something, such as a good or service. Creativity is the ability to generate unique ideas,
approaches, and solutions. People, not businesses, have creative abilities.

Customer injury. If a customer is hurt (e.g., falling on a wet floor) while on a business's property, the
business may be legally responsible for compensating the customer (e.g., medical bills, lost wages)
because the business was negligent. Businesses can purchase liability insurance to reduce the risk of
extreme financial losses due to circumstances such as customer injury. A business purchases commercial
property insurance for protection against property loss. Credit insurance protects a manufacturing or
wholesale business from losses due to its customers' debt. Disability insurance provides a person with
payment in the event the person is unable to work.

Purchasing insurance. Insurance is a contractual agreement in which one company (insurer) will pay for
specified losses incurred by the other company (insured) in return for installment payments (premiums). By
purchasing business insurance, businesses can reduce the amount they must pay for financial losses
(liability) that result from accidents, fires, or other business risks. Responsible businesses review their
assets and liabilities on a regular basis, so they can make sure that they have enough insurance to cover
potential losses. Legal counsel, negotiation, and risk assessment do not necessarily limit a business's
liability.

Yes, if the agreement does not violate statutory law. A contract is an agreement between two or more
parties stating that one party is to do something in return for something provided by another party. Oral
agreements are legal and enforceable if they contain agreement, consideration, and capacity (mental
competency), and do not involve illegal activities. For example, some governments prohibit gambling, which
would make an oral agreement to pay a gambling debt illegal and unenforceable. Non­compete clauses are
stipulations in an employer/employee contract that state that the employee promises not to work for the
employer's competitors for a certain time upon leaving his/her job with the company.

while other employers do not. A personal contract must be in writing if it is a type of contract that is
described in the Statute of Frauds.

Contracted to work on federal projects. Affirmative action is an effort to give special employment
consideration to disadvantaged groups. In the United States, affirmative action programs are not mandated
for all businesses, but are required under certain circumstances. For example, companies that perform
contract work for government projects or organizations that receive federal funding (e.g., state colleges) are
required to meet specific criteria and have a documented affirmative action plan in place. The U.S.
government does not mandate that businesses have affirmative action programs if the businesses are
private corporations, unable to meet financial objectives, or suffer from credibility problems.

Monitor service quality. Many governments guarantee their citizens certain rights to privacy. However,
privacy laws in the workplace vary by country, state, and province. Generally, the act of listening to
employees' telephone calls is a legitimate practice when it relates to specific business activities, such as
monitoring service quality. To maintain trust within the organization, employers should tell employees about
the telephone surveillance policies. Telephone surveillance does not improve employees' morale.
Monitoring telephone calls to obtain personal information may be a tort involving the invasion of privacy.
Businesses do not dismiss highly productive workers unless there is just cause.

Whistle­blower. A whistle­blower is an employee who reports his/her employer's illegal or unethical business

Identify and prosecute wrongdoers. Wrongdoings that occur over computer networks (Internet) are cyber
crimes. Because these types of wrongdoings often do not involve physical evidence, such as fingerprints
and DNA, it is often difficult to identify who is responsible for the wrongdoing and hold him/her accountable
for his/her actions. A cyber crime's physical evidence does not determine tort duties, nor does it affect the
ability to monitor or control appellate judges. It might be difficult to retrieve government records if the cyber
crime involved government computer networks, but not all cyber crimes involve government information,
which is usually under high security.

Identity theft. Theft occurs when one person takes someone else's property without his/her knowledge and
consent. Most countries consider stealing an illegal activity. The Internet allows people to purchase products
and pay bills by using their computers. As a result, personal information such as bank account numbers and
credit card numbers are often subject to theft. Computer hackers are people who break into others'
computer networks. Many hackers engage in identity theft (stealing) by accessing others' banking and credit
information and using the information for their own benefit. Businesses must take reasonable care to
provide their customers with security to avoid customer lawsuits. Embezzlement occurs when an employee
steals from his/her employer. A server is a main computer that stores information. Contract interference
occurs when one party takes action that results in a contract being lost or invalidated for another party.

productivity. Because there is always a risk associated electronic transmission (e.g., hackers, e­mail

Yes, when proof shows that two or more people share profits, a relationship may exist under the partnership
by implication provision. In some countries (e.g., United States), a legal provision states that involuntary
partnerships can exist in certain situations (e.g., the ongoing sharing of profits) without legal documents to
acknowledge the partnership. The partnership by implication provision is valid when two or more people are
involved, rather than three or more people. Documents such as bank statements and correspondence can
prove that a partnership relationship exists even though the partners may file separate income tax reports.
Although circumstances depend on the physical location of the partnership, most general partnerships are
not required to file the articles of partnership form.

Articles of incorporation. Businesses must take many legal steps when forming a corporation. One step in
forming a corporation is applying for a charter with the appropriate government agency. This also involves
completing a legal document often referred to as the articles of incorporation. This document includes
information, such as the formation date, duration, type of business, share­issuance information, etc.
Statement of corporate intent, certificate of corporate entity, and deed of incorporation are fictitious terms.

Price fixing. Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which competing businesses agree on prices of
their products, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Pricing fixing also keeps smaller businesses from
being able to compete with those businesses that engage in the illegal activity. Therefore, the antitrust laws
not only protect consumers, they also protect other businesses from being unfairly pushed out of the
market. Monopoly refers to a condition in which one supplier controls a market and there are no substitute
goods or services readily available. Antitrust laws are in place to protect consumers and businesses from
monopolistic activities; however, the term equitable monopoly is not one that is widely recognized in the
business law field. International trade and sponsorship exploitation are not illegal activities that are usually
regulated by antitrust laws.

Creative expression. Intellectual property is a person's ideas or formulas, which are intangible by nature and
are made tangible through creative expression. This creative expression includes numerical notations,
scientific testing, words, art, sculpture, processes, recipes, trade secrets, etc. People can protect their
intellectual property from the unauthorized use of others by registering with the government for a copyright,
trademark, or patent. Intellectual property does not become tangible through applied mathematics, scientific
testing, or documented words.

Fair use. The fair use provision allows someone to use or reference copyrighted materials in some
situations. For example, it is permissible for a student to quote an excerpt of a poem in a research paper if
the creator or source is identified in the document. Since the student is not receiving a financial reward and
is limiting its use to a single research paper, the fair use provision is applicable. Restricted access and
limited admittance are not terms widely used to describe the use of copyrighted materials. A pooling
agreement occurs when a corporation's stockholders agree to vote a certain way.

Nonobvious, useful, and novel. These are the three requirements for a product to be patentable. The Patent

holder to recover damages. The product need not be profitable or eccentric. The product should not be
obvious or improved. Finally, the product need not be fundamental.

issues. Deportation refers to the removal or expulsion of a person from a country. Disintermediation is the

occurred. Pretrial conference involves preparing for trial activities and occurs after the arraignment. When a
defendant appeals a court decision, s/he requests that the appellate court review the trial court's decision.

Profit maximization. Some business activities are legal but do not reflect the depth of an individual's or
company's ethics (moral code). Therefore, when a company performs normal business activities, it must
consider its social responsibility—its duty to contribute to the well­being of society. Part of a company's
social responsibility involves how much profit the business makes. Profit maximization happens when a
company prices products to gain as much profit as the market will tolerate. Opponents of profit maximization
believe that the concept has the potential for businesses to behave unethically by charging too much for
products. Profit maximization supporters believe that the company is providing jobs and enhancing
economic stability within the community, so it has the right to make as much profit as possible. In addition, a
company must make enough profit to pay employees, buy supplies, and cover other expenses. Price
gouging, deceptive labeling, and insider trading are illegal activities.

Resource allocation. Resources are the things that are used to produce goods and services and to run a
business. Business resources might include money, raw materials, personnel, and vendors. A business that
has legal problems often moves and uses its resources in other ways. For example, a business might
reallocate some of its profits to pay for lawyers. Or, employees might take time away from their jobs to
testify on the company's behalf. A distribution channel is the route a product takes to reach the end user. A
distribution channel is one of a business's resources and is not always affected by a company's legal
issues. Property value is the amount of money that something (e.g., land, equipment) is worth. Purchasing
procedures are the guidelines a business uses to buy goods and services. Property values and purchasing
procedures are not always primary business components that are affected by a company's legal problems.

Legislative. There are three governing powers of the U.S. government and each area is designed to provide

A person is allowed to vote at the age of eighteen. Laws are the rules that govern a person's behavior. Laws
help maintain order within a group. Substantive laws are rules that identify and protect a person's rights and
responsibilities. A law that states that an eighteen­year­old citizen can vote is expressing a person's right to
make his/her voice heard, and his/her responsibility to be an involved citizen. The location of a trial, the
required size of a jury, and a prison sentence are examples of situations that involve procedural laws.

unlawful conduct, managers cannot be held liable. While management could be held liable for lack of
awareness about unlawful activity, managers should be aware of what constitutes unlawful activity before
hiring. If management is aware of what constitutes lawful activity, managers should be able to avoid
unlawful acts by strong supervision of employees.

Arbitration clauses. Arbitration is a method to resolve conflicts that involves a neutral third party who is

businesses include arbitration clauses in their contracts to stipulate that disputes can be heard and resolved
through arbitration. Ethics are principles that govern a person's behavior. Bylaws are an organization's (e.g.,
corporation) internal rules. Including personal ethical standards and bylaws in a sales contract does not
mean that a business will avoid litigating disputes. Statute of negotiable cause is a fictitious term.

A substantial controversy. A contract is an agreement between two parties (e.g., individuals, groups,

Before a court will hear the case (lawsuit), the contract breech must meet several criteria. The breech must
be real (not hypothetical), and it must be controversial enough to bring the issue before a court. To be
substantially controversial, the issue must involve a certain amount of money, or some type of harm to the
other party. Criminal activities are tried in a criminal court. A breech of contract may or may not involve harm
to a third party and does not necessarily involve joint liability.

As is. Under tort law in many states, disclaimers (e.g., as is) that attempt to relieve a seller of product
liability or warranty responsibility are not valid or recognized. Therefore, a seller of a product can be held
liable for product malfunction when the product holds an "as is" disclaimer. A product that is "not returnable"
does not necessarily mean that the seller does not accept product liability (e.g., warranty). Products that are
marked "inspected by" or "checked by" show the customer that the items have met quality assurances and
standards.

Restrict competition. An exclusive dealing arrangement between a supplier and an intermediary states that
the intermediary will distribute only that supplier's products and will not handle a competitor's products. An
exclusive territory gives one business the right to sell a product in a certain area, thereby preventing other
businesses from selling that product. Both arrangements restrict competition because they put controls on
who may sell products and what products they may sell. These types of distribution arrangements do not
eliminate middlemen, regulate marketing, or limit advertising.

The supplier employs full­line forcing without allowing competing products. The practice of full­line forcing by
a supplier is designed to ensure that intermediaries acquire new products and make available to customers
a suitable range of products. Suppliers requiring channel members to purchase their entire line to obtain any
of their products is a type of tying agreement and is legal as long as competitive brands are also allowed to
be carried. Tying agreements are legal when the supplier alone can provide the products and when a
company has just entered the market.

Slotting allowances. A slotting allowance is a cash premium that manufacturers pay to businesses to cover
the costs involved in carrying a new product. In many cases, the cash premium is substantial because there
is a lot of competition among manufacturers to encourage businesses to carry their products. Often, the
manufacturer that offers the largest allowance is the one that gets shelf space for its new product. This may
be unethical because small manufacturers that cannot afford to pay large slotting allowances do not have
an equal opportunity to distribute their products. The gray market involves buying from unauthorized
distributors. Channel strategies are distribution plans. Targeted advertising involves focusing on a specific
group.

Possible objections. The purpose of a persuasive letter is to convey information that encourages the reader
to take a specific course of action. For example, the purpose of a letter from a business's legal department
might be to motivate a person to pay a past­due account. An objection is a reason for not taking a specific
course of action. When developing persuasive messages, it is important for the writers to think about the
readers' possible objections and acknowledge them. By acknowledging the objections and providing a
rationale that removes the objections, the writers better position themselves in persuading the readers to
take specific actions. Because each reader has different personal images and decision­making styles, it is

To analyze marketing trends. Complicated and important topics, such as marketing trends, are analyzed in
complex written reports. The purpose of complex reports is to define a specific topic or problem area,
present and interpret data, draw conclusions, and make recommendations. Supervisors prepare complex
written reports in order to gather all the pertinent information that will help them in making important
decisions. They generally use memorandums to request pricing information and to schedule training
sessions. Compiling sales expenses is an accounting function.

Demonstrate tasks. Supervisors often train new employees on­the­job by giving instructions about their
assignments and then demonstrating the tasks. By combining oral instructions with actual demonstrations,
supervisors are able to effectively teach employees how to complete job tasks. Employees have a better
understanding of their jobs once they have seen them demonstrated. Supervisors complete paperwork and
introduce staff before giving job instructions to new employees. Supervisors do not organize questions but
are prepared to answer any questions that new employees may have about job tasks.

Fixed costs. Economies of scale are characteristics that allow a business to increase output without
experiencing a comparable increase in the cost of production. The fixed costs of production remain constant
so the overall cost of producing more and more products actually decreases. For example, once an electric
plant is built, the cost of producing electricity decreases because the cost of building the facility is spread
over more and more units of electricity. In a business that has economies of scale, net profits may increase,
which will lead to an increase in income tax. Pay rates usually do not decrease as a result of economies of
scale.

Economic instability. Interest rate is the percentage figure used in calculating interest charges. The interest
is the price of borrowing money. Interest rates rising and falling by a wide range on a regular basis often is
an indication of economic instability. The interest rate has an effect on the amount of money available to
loan and the amount that businesses and individuals are willing to borrow. For example, when rates are
high, borrowing decreases because the price of borrowing is high. This tends to slow down the economy. In
a stable economy, interest rates remain fairly constant and fluctuate by only a few percentage points.
Interest rates rising and falling by a wide range on a regular basis is not an indication of seasonal
unemployment, flexible capital, or price equilibrium.

activities including advertising. The advantage of having money to spend on advertising is that advertising
often results in increased sales. The increased sales generate additional profit which can be used to repay
the money borrowed through financing. Assets are anything of value that the business owns. Quotas are
specific goals to be met. Risks are chances of loss.

To avoid financial crisis. It is important for a business to budget a certain amount of money to savings to
avoid financial crisis. With a budget that includes a plan for savings, there is a better chance of being able to

that it should not hire more employees or purchase additional inventory. Using the operating budget

6.1%. Businesses often calculate the return on sales ratio to determine profitability for a certain period of
time. The formula for determining return on sales is net profit divided by sales ($520,500 ÷ $85,000 = 6.12
or 6.1%). Depending on the type of business, a 6% return on sales may be an acceptable profit. If not, the
business may decide that it is spending too much on the sales effort and needs to reduce costs or increase
prices in order to increase profits.

Severance package. When businesses (e.g., law firms) dismiss employees, they often provide some type of

businesses provide additional support services in a severance package, such as counseling and assistance
with finding a new position. A layoff involves letting employees go for a short amount of time because of a
shortage of work. These employees are not being terminated because they will be called back to work.
Employees who are being dismissed are not retiring.

Reward. Many law firms reward employees who develop new or creative ways of doing their jobs, or ways
of saving the law firm money. The reward is a way of recognizing an employee's effort and motivating
him/her to continue to be productive and creative. An example of a reward is a free cruise. If employees
know they will be rewarded for contributing to the success of the law firm, they often are motivated to do
more than is routinely expected of them. A bonus usually is a cash reward such as offering $100 for each
new idea that the law firm actually implements. A prize usually is a reward for winning a contest, such as
giving a free cruise to a lawyer who won the most cases in June. A vacation is time off from work that an
employee is entitled to take.

Attracting and keeping qualified employees. A law firm's pay and benefit program is one factor that attracts
employees to the firm. Therefore, law firms often use the program as a recruiting tool and also as a method
of keeping qualified employees. For example, some law firms offer high pay scales and many benefits that
appeal to potential employees. Also, these firms know that keeping qualified employees is less costly than
dealing with a high turnover rate and continually training new employees. Therefore, the high pay and
benefits help to keep employees satisfied. Law firms do not use the pay and benefit program as a method of
recognizing employees for their achievements, compensating employees based on seniority, or promoting
the most productive employees.

Lower credibility. If a business presents marketing data in a deceptive way, the business is acting
unethically. Reporting incorrect statistics and intentionally ignoring certain variables to reflect a specific
outcome is deceptive. If the dishonest behavior is uncovered, the business is most likely to lose credibility. If
a business is deceptive about its marketing research and it experiences a lower level of credibility, the
business might find that its customer loyalty levels decrease because the customers view the business as
dishonest. Depending on the size and reputation of the business that reports deceptive marketing
information, the business's visibility in the media may increase for a short time.

Insurance purposes. Businesses are required to keep accident records for insurance purposes. Providers of
workers' compensation insurance want to know what types of accidents are occurring at the workplace,
what types of injuries result, and what types of medical treatment are sought. This information helps to
determine how much a business's workers' compensation insurance will cost. The Good Samaritan Law
protects individuals from liability when they administer accepted first aid to injured persons. Personal liability
means that an individual is responsible for any damage that might occur. The Social Security Act provides
for retirement and disability insurance.

increase or decrease in proportion to sales volume. In this example, add the cost of rent, salaries,

have to pay them for vacation or sick time or provide additional costly benefits that full­time employees
receive. The advantage to the business is the same number of employees working during a given time
period but for less wages. Businesses do not hire part­time employees rather than full­time employees to
obtain qualified workers, eliminate interviews, or identify resources.

activities can reinforce or renew a person's interest in his/her career, that is the not primary reason for
participating in career development activities.

Briefly describe her previous job responsibilities. A resume should briefly present all relevant information
that would help an employer select an applicant to interview. In the work­experience portion of the resume,
the applicant should identify all jobs in reverse chronological order, starting with the current or most recent
job. The applicant should provide the name and address of the employer, the time period of employment,
and the nature of the job responsibilities. Work interests and career goals, technical training, and the
applicant's address and telephone information are found in other sections of the resume.

A local ice­cream shop prices menu items below cost in an effort to eliminate its competition. Predatory
pricing is an aggressive pricing strategy that sells goods below cost in an effort to put the competition out of
business, leaving fewer choices for consumers. Many governments have regulations to control the practice
of predatory pricing. A salesperson who encourages a customer to purchase an extended vehicle warranty
for a new car is engaging in suggestive selling. A tire producer that introduces a new item to its product line
and sets the initial price very low is using a penetration pricing strategy. An international book publisher that
sells similar products to similar customers at different prices is engaging in price discrimination.

Fixing. Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which businesses agree on prices of their goods and
services, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Price discrimination is an illegal activity in which a
business charges different customers different prices for similar amounts and types of products. Coercion is
forcing a person to do something s/he does not want to do. Altering is changing prices, which is not always
an illegal action.

Environment. When a business makes its products from recyclable goods, or items that can be used again
(e.g., paper), it is exhibiting responsible and ethical behavior. The business is taking steps to save and
protect the earth's natural resources by creating something out of used or discarded items. Although
governments have laws to protect the environment, recycling is not always legislated. If a government does
have recycling regulations for businesses, the businesses are following the law rather than protecting the
law. Making products from recyclable goods does not directly protect the distribution channel or the market
segment.

Consumer protection. Consumer protection involves all efforts to safeguard consumers from any kind of
injury to themselves, their property, or their rights as a result of the negligence, failure to act, or unlawful act
of others. In this case, the Henderson Soap Company and the government had to make sure that the
product was safe to use without any further skin damage to customers. Consumer product testing involves
obtaining feedback from customers about a product's taste, smell, usage, etc., so that the manufacturer can
modify the product to better satisfy consumers. Publicity is any nonpersonal presentation of ideas, goods, or
services that is not paid for by the company or individual which benefits from or is harmed by it. Product
liability is the producer's responsibility for any injury that the business's products may cause.

Fraud. Fraud is a deception purposely carried out to secure unfair or unlawful gain. The nature of
promotional activities, such as sweepstakes and contests, indicates that the activities can and have been
carried out in ways that deceive or unfairly treat participants. Therefore, governments often develop and
enforce laws that protect consumers from deceptive or unfair practices which relate specifically to
sweepstakes and contests. Tax evasion occurs when a business avoids paying monies that it owes the
government. Slander is a verbal statement that one party makes with the intent to harm another party's
character. Price fixing is an illegal agreement in which businesses agree on the prices of their goods and
services.

Code of ethics. Code of ethics is a universal term used to describe an established set of guidelines that
people are expected to follow in regard to behaviors and actions while representing a group or organization.
In the business world, companies vary in terms of the specific principles that govern a code of ethics.
Bylaws are rules that establish guidelines to regulate how an organization is operated or governed.
Corporate bylaws are the rules established for a corporation. Charter of selling behavior and principles of
moral conduct are terms that can be used to describe ethical regulation, but are generally not considered
universal terms.

Prevent bribery. A bribe is an illegal payment intended to secure business or products in return. Although
bribery is illegal, it still exists and is a major aspect of "white collar crime." Because there is often a thin line
between bribery and giving gifts, many businesses establish their own guidelines and rules concerning gift
giving. These guidelines are intended to reinforce laws against bribery so salespeople do not accidentally
overstep their bounds and do something that may be illegal. When salespeople offer cash or other gifts to
customers in exchange for their business, they are not violating sales regulations intended to control false
promises, encourage reciprocity, or monitor price discrimination.

Organizing. Organizing is the management function of setting up the way the business's work will be done.
Directing is the management function of providing guidance to workers and work projects. Controlling is the
management function that monitors the work effort. Planning is the management function of deciding what
will be done and how it will be accomplished.

Marketing plan. A business plan is a set of procedures or strategies that outlines how a person plans to take
an idea and turn it into an organized effort to produce and/or distribute goods and services. The business
plan consists of three basic components—a business description and situational analysis, a marketing plan,
and a financial plan. Pricing policies are discussed in the marketing plan. Segment analysis is part of the
business description and situational analysis.
