a variety of laws. For example, a business can protect its distinctive name and symbol by registering a
trademark. A trademark is a symbol, design, or word used by a business to identify a good or service. By
registering its trademark, others are prohibited from using or copying it without the business's permission.
Original novels and movies are protected by copyrights. New products and processes, and creative

Rights of business. Many governmental agencies are responsible for enforcing rules and regulations that
are intended to protect the rights of businesses. Some of these agencies help to keep the marketplace
competitive and protect businesses' trade secrets and formulas from being stolen. The agencies often
develop a strong relationship with businesses in the process of protecting their rights. Governmental
agencies do not protect the barriers to trade, the target market, or the monetary policy.

Concentrating on remembering what the speaker says. One technique people use to improve listening
skills is to make a conscious effort to try to focus and remember what the speaker says. Staying focused
on the message and filtering out noise as much as possible improves the chances of remembering and
accurately understanding the message. Listeners may want to be aware of their own body language
(e.g., facial expressions, crossed arms) because their nonverbal cues are also being interpreted by the
speaker and can affect communication. However, monitoring one's own nonverbal cues does not
necessarily mean that the listener takes control of the conversation. Thinking about how to respond to
messages while the speaker is talking is a barrier to active listening. To decipher a message accurately,
the listener must not only pay attention to the speaker's words but also to her/his nonverbal cues and
voice tone. Nonverbal cues are not necessarily more important than tone of voice.

Yes, if the employee advises the customer that s/he will get the information and will respond to the
customer as soon as possible. If an employee doesn't know the answer to a question, s/he should be
honest with the customer. However, it is important for the employee to go a step further. This step might
involve letting the customer know where s/he can find the information or for employee to obtain the
information and provide the customer with an answer in a timely manner. Customers are more likely to
respect an employee who is honest with them and is willing to do what s/he can to help them. Employees
should not guess because the information they provide may be incorrect or misleading. Employees do
not need to know every aspect of the business; however, they should learn enough about the business to
know from where or from whom the customer can obtain the desired information.

Credibility. Credibility is achieved when the audience has confidence in the persuader. In this case, Dr.
Browne's prestigious job title and degree lead the audience to believe she is a credible source. Reason
is when logic is used to persuade someone to do something. It often involves solid facts and statistics.
An emotional appeal affects the audience's feelings, such as sympathy or love. An appeal that uses
shock value is a form of an emotional appeal that includes information that the audience would find
shocking.

A statement of the report's purpose. The executive summary provides an overview of the entire report
and contains the most important information included in the body of the report. The first section of the
executive summary should inform the reader about the purpose of the reportthe reason the report
exists. For example, if the report addresses a specific business problem, the report should cite the
problem in the purpose statement of the executive summary. Recommendations are addressed in the
recommendations section of the report. A letter of authorization might be included in a proposal that a
business submits to a potential client. By signing the letter of authorization, the client provides approval to
proceed with an activity or project. The first section of an executive summary does not acknowledge
sponsors. Sponsors support activities, events, or projects rather than reports.

Informal, because she knows the team members well and addresses them informally on a day-to-day
basis. Short reports, such as emails, usually involve personal relationships where the communicators
know each other well and comfortably address each other informally at the workplace and in written
communications. Generally, email (especially those messages between people who know each other
well) is used to quickly communicate, and therefore is written informally. A progress report gives
members of a team or their supervisors information on the status of a project. It is not transmitted outside
this group. Simple reports, such as those conveyed by email, do not adhere to the rules of a complex
structured report. No title page or executive summary is necessary.

Recommendations. An analytical report is a document that explains and evaluates an issue, opportunity,
or problem. A component of the analytical report is the recommendations section, which provides the
reader with advice for resolving a problem or acting on an opportunity. The recommendations appear at
the end of the report after background information, research, results, and facts have been presented.
Writers should include logical arguments for analytical reports in which the topic is controversial, and the
audience may disagree with some of the report's information. By providing logical arguments, the writer is
more likely to persuade the audience to accept the conclusions. An analytical report may address
external factors or the progress of an action, but including this type of information depends on the nature
of the report's topic.

Purpose of the study. A research report is a written document that summarizes an investigation related to
a particular issue or problem. A research report contains many elements. The purpose of the study states
why the topic at hand is being investigated. The purpose of the study should be described in the report's
introduction, which is at the beginning of the report. Stating the purpose of the study is important because
it lets readers know what they are reading and why. Proposed solutions to a problem (recommendations)
are addressed near the end of the document after the research has been presented. The appendices are
segments that include supporting information, and are added to the end of a document. The bibliography
contains the list of resources from which the writer obtained information for the report. The bibliography is
generally placed at the end of the research reportafter the recommendations section and before the
appendices.

coworkers if they want to.

Telling their customers the truth. A service orientation is the philosophy of providing quality service to
customers. Businesses reinforce this orientation through communication. To be effective, the
communication should be truthful and provide customers with accurate information and correct answers
to their questions. Even if the answers are not the ones that customers want, they will respect the
business for being truthful. For example, it is better to tell customers that their orders will be shipped in
five days rather than promise shipment in two days if that is not possible. Businesses do not reinforce
their service orientation through communication by distributing financial reports, sending directive
memos, or writing appealing news releases.

Consumer demand. When demand for a product is high, production is increased to ensure that adequate
quantities are available for sale. When demand is low, production is cut back to prevent the possibility of
loss from surplus products that cannot be sold at prices high enough to cover the costs of production.
The utility, or usefulness, of a product helps to create consumer demand for that product. Demand may,
or may not, be affected by factors in the environment.

Maximizing their profits. A business that maximizes its profits grows and is able to provide profits to
stockholders, benefits to its employees, and jobs for more workers. To do this, the business must offer
quality products at competitive prices rather than trying to produce low-priced products. Businesses are
required by law to pay income tax. Their political donations must also follow legal guidelines since such
gifts are more likely to be given to benefit the business than in an effort to be socially responsible.

Development of new products. Competition encourages businesses to develop new products in order to
meet consumers' needs. Businesses feel that the company which best satisfies consumers will be the
most successful company. Competition helps to control prices because businesses must keep prices in
line with production costs in order to be competitive. Businesses must also maintain or improve product
quality to be competitive. A monopoly exists when a market is controlled by one supplier, and there are
no substitute goods or services readily available. No competition exists in a true monopoly.

Depression. In an economic depression, consumers often choose to save their incomes due to
uncertainty about the future. Many of them also lose their jobs, so there is more incentive to save than to
spend. In a period of economic expansion, consumers spend more and save less because they are
optimistic about the future. During times of economic recession, consumers are inclined to save more
and spend less; however, it is for a shorter time period than an economic depression. In an economic
recovery, consumers begin to spend again because there is optimism about the future of the economy.

An individualist society. An individualist society is one in which group ties are loose and everyone is

Because self-reliant people are independent, they take pride in accomplishing goals on their own.
Collectivism embraces interdependence, group affiliation, and team orientation. A long-term oriented
society focuses on future rewards and values actions such as persistence.

Time. The concept of time is an important consideration when doing business with foreigners. In some
cultures (e.g., Germany), punctuality is very important; therefore, it is important to be on time to any
meetings or social gatherings. In other cultures, time is less important or is viewed differently. For
example, in some countries, businesspeople will keep people waiting while they finish another activity, so
that s/he can provide the visitor with his/her undivided attention. This action may appear rude to people in
some cultures, while it is viewed as a courtesy in other cultures. Spatial issues refer to the amount of
personal space (close, distant) different cultures allow during interpersonal interaction. Achievement is
the level to which a person reaches his/her personal goals. Education is the type and level of training or
schooling that a person has obtained.

Appropriate personal appearance. Personal appearance is the physical image an individual creates by
how s/he looks and what s/he wears. In many countries such as Argentina, businesspeople are judged
on their appearance; therefore, it is important to dress for success to communicate a professional
attitude. The type of clothing that a person wears does not relate to his/her gestures, problem-solving
skills, table manners, or business management style.

Language barriers. Misusing and mispronouncing words in another language can create a lot of
misunderstandings and be very embarrassing in a business situation. When language is an issue, it is
often best to hire a professional translator for meetings with foreign businesspeople. Nonverbal cues
(body language) are gestures, facial expressions, and the way people carry their bodies. The example
does not provide enough information to determine if Kevin and Mr. Suzuki have different work ethics or if
they have attitude problems related to change.

Bribery. Gift giving practices vary greatly among countries. In some countries, it is customary, or
expected, to give gifts in business situations. In China, gift giving is a ritual that promotes a sincere desire
to build positive, collaborative business relationships. However, foreigners should not give Chinese
businesspeople overly expensive or extravagant gifts, which may unintentionally suggest a bribe. Bribery
is an illegal payment intended to secure business or products in return. Industrious means hardworking.

Monitor their behavior. A gesture, facial expression, or action may be perfectly acceptable in one culture
but offensive in another culture. Therefore, a businessperson should become familiar with a foreign
country's customs, attitudes, and codes of acceptable conduct before important business meetings, so
s/he does not behave in an offensive manner. Although it is important to dress appropriately, verify
language translations, and understand the country's attitude of punctuality (time), these actions do not
relate to the nonverbal cues or body language presented in the example.

Obtaining a report from a credit bureau. By reviewing her credit-history reports, Jane can determine if

rating, which "scores" the individual's ability or willingness to pay previous loans. Individuals often
validate their credit history before applying for additional credit to make sure that the information in the
history is accurate. Businesses review a person's credit report to make decisions about extending credit
to him/her. Jane cannot obtain her credit rating by adding together her credit-card balances or by

Corporate-level. Large businesses often have many projects occurring at the same time. In some
situations, different projects need to access the same data. Corporate-level project-management
software is a powerful tool because it provides the ability to track hundreds of tasks and several projects
at one time. Corporate-level project-management software typically provides cost accounting, resource
leveling, "what-if" analyses, charting, and reporting capabilities. Some corporate-level software programs
allow businesses to select other software options to accommodate their specific needs. Single-project
programs are used for individual (single) projects. Scheduling software has fewer options than corporatelevel
programs, and contains primarily scheduling, Gnatt charts, and presentation capabilities. Costing is
a software capability rather than a type of project-management software program.

make adjustments, so it can accomplish its goals. Businesses analyze many types of situations.
Production is the process of producing goods and services. When the business detects production
problems (e.g., output decreases), it needs to obtain data to find out why problems are occurring, so it
can take the appropriate steps to resolve the problem. Distribution is the business function of moving or
transferring the ownership of goods or services from producers to consumers. Finance is the business
function that involves the management of money. Human resources are the people who work to produce

The employees' personal ethics may differ from the business's ethics. Ethics are the basic principles that
govern your behavior. Because people differ, their personal ethics often differ. Employees often view
ethics differently when they encounter "gray" situations, or situations in which there is not a clear right or
wrong action or answer. Therefore, it is important for a business to clearly communicate its code of ethics
to its employees, so they understand how they are to behave in business situations. By communicating
the business's code of ethics in the workplace, the business is controlling or reducing its risk of potential
legal problems (e.g., lawsuits) and financial losses, which may occur when employees do not know the
business's ethical expectations and rules. Businesses often document ethical issues and expectations in
their employee handbooks. Ethics are a stable pattern of behavior exhibited over time. Therefore,
businesses do not frequently change their ethics. Governments do not require all businesses to offer

What-if planning. Companies often use computer software programs to analyze their levels of risk in
different business functions. The software calculates a company's risk levels in a variety of scenarios
based on different types of data queries. By establishing queries using different combinations of data, the
company obtains results under many circumstances. The company analyzes the quantitative results of
each scenario and uses them to make business decisions. This process is what-if planning. Qualitative
research is a study based on opinion or expertise. Top-down forecasting is a method of predicting sales.
During the product-development process, businesses conduct product feasibility studies to determine the
advantages and disadvantages of producing a certain good or service.

Negligence. A customer may file a negligence lawsuit against a business if s/he feels that the business
has failed to protect her/him from harm or wrongdoing. To minimize their chances of being sued for
negligence, risk managers and business owners develop specific policies and procedures to protect
customers from being injured and to avoid being blamed for customer injuries, if they occur. An individual
may file a private nuisance lawsuit if s/he has been unable to live peacefully at home as a result of a
neighbor's barking dog, teenagers having a loud party nearby, etc. If someone fails to fulfill his/her
contract (e.g., does not complete promised work, does not pay for services rendered, etc.), the individual
or company who entered into that contract with the violator might file a breach-of-contract against
him/her. People file discrimination lawsuits when they feel that they were treated unfairly because of their
race, religion, gender, or other characteristic.

Staffing. Staffing enables the business to have employees who know how to do the company's work or
are capable of learning how to do it. In a large business, a separate department usually handles staffing
because it is a full-time responsibility to keep up with the staffing needs of the business. Planning is
deciding what will be done and how it will be accomplished. Directing is providing guidance to workers
and work projects. Controlling is monitoring the work effort.

Planning. Planning is the management function of deciding what will be done and how it will be
accomplished. Brainstorming is a creative-thinking technique that is often used during the planning
process. Deciding what will be done involves establishing objectives. After establishing objectives, the

to determine if it achieved its objectives.

Finances. Controlling the finances of a business is critical if the business wants to succeed. Managers
need to understand the finances and be able to use financial tools, such as income statements and
balance sheets, to monitor the business's income and expenses. Managers need to be prepared to take
action to correct problems with the bottom line if financial controls indicate that the business is losing
money. It is not possible to control competitors. Benefits and incentives are advantages or payments
employees receive in addition to their wages. Businesses usually establish benefit and incentive
programs that are comparable to those of similar businesses in the same industry. Reducing benefits and
incentives is a step that managers might take if they identify a problem with the business's finances.

Concurrent control. Concurrent controls monitor business activities as they are being performed. The
assistant bank manager watched and listened to her tellers carrying out their jobs, realized that there was
a problem, and immediately corrected the problem. Preventive controls take place before a business
activity takes place, while feedback controls occur after a business activity has been completed. Post
controls, more commonly referred to as postcontrols, are feedback controls.
