Accepted. Contracts are agreements between two or more parties stating that one party is to do
something in return for something provided by another party. Several elements must be present for a
contract to be valid. First, one party must make an offer to do something, such as sell a product for a
certain price and deliver it on a certain date. Then, the other party must accept that offer. A valid contract
cannot be formed unless the offer is accepted. The offer may be made verbally or in writing. Express and
implied are types of contracts that may be formed once the offer is accepted.

Trade restraints. Various regulations that control how the ownership of goods is transferred are intended
to prevent trade restraints. One type of restraint of trade is horizontal and involves businesses on the
same level trying to form monopolies or drive competitors out of business. Another type of restraint of
trade is vertical and involves the various businesses in a chain of distribution forming agreements that
also discourage competition. For example, regulations prevent one business from developing exclusive
arrangements with another business or setting prices solely for the purpose of restraining trade and
making it difficult, or impossible, for others to compete fairly. Regulations that control how the ownership
of goods is transferred are not intended to prevent economic competition, property liability, or shipping
damages.

Distribution. Business laws are rules that govern activities that involve the production, consumption, and
distribution of goods and services. The purpose of business laws is to protect consumers and businesses
from the unfair practices of other businesses. Expansion and contraction are stages in the product life
cycle. A resolution is an outcome or remedy to a situation.

The U.S. Congress. A primary source of law provides the foundation for societal rules. In the United
States, the U.S. Constitution is the supreme primary source of law. The U.S. Constitution is the basis
upon which other sources develop, implement, enforce, and interpret various types of laws. Laws that are
written and passed by the U.S. Congress (Senate and House of Representatives) are called federal
statutes, which are sources of primary law. State laws and administrative agencies (e.g., Federal Trade
Commission) are sources of primary law but are not enacted by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Supreme
Court interprets laws.

Prosecutor. A crime is a wrongdoing against society. The plaintiff is the accuser or alleged victim of a
crime. In a criminal trial, the prosecutor represents the case for the accuser and is usually a government
official. The public defender is the attorney that represents the defendant or the accused. A principal is a
person who hires an agent to conduct business activities on his/her behalf. The grand jury is a group of
people who determine if there is enough evidence to bring a case to trial.

Federal district. The U.S. federal district court hears cases that involve a federal question, the diversity of
citizenship, or those in which the U.S. is a party (defendant, plaintiff). Since the U.S. government is the
plaintiff that is accusing the defendant (company president) of insider trading, the federal district court
presides over the case. State supreme courts and state appellate courts hear cases involving state
matters, rather than federal ones. Probate courts deal primarily with cases involving wills and estates.

Fine. A remedy is an action that a governing body imposes to correct a wrongdoing. A business that does
not file its tax return on time would most likely pay a monetary fine to the government. Severe infractions
such as embezzlement or intentional physical harm would most likely require a person to serve a prison
term. Parole is an aspect of remedy in which a person is released from prison with the stipulation that
s/he must follow certain guidelines that the court establishes. When a jury or governing body finds that a
person is not guilty of a tort or crime, it is called an acquittal.

Criminal punishments often involve prison sentences while tort punishments do not. A person who
commits a wrongdoing against society is guilty of a crime. A tort is a private wrongdoing against another
person. Punishments for crimes and punishments for torts are different. A defendant who is guilty of a
crime receives his/her punishment in a variety of ways, which might include serving a prison sentence
and/or probation, conducting community service, paying government fines, or performing a combination
of these options. Tort punishments usually involve paying monetary compensation to the plaintiff or
stopping the activities that violate the plaintiff's rights.

Negligent. Tort laws address issues about private wrongdoings against individuals. When a person does
intentional or unintentional harm to another, the person is behaving in a careless or negligent manner,
which violates the tort duty to care. Systematic means orderly. A person who acts in a systematic,
cautious, or sensible manner is not necessarily violating his/her duty to care.

No, directors who show reasonable duty of care are not always liable, and are protected by the business
judgment rule. A corporation's directors may be liable for the negligent actions of a company employee if
evidence exists that the director ordered, knew about, or covered up the action. The business judgment
rule protects a director from liability when evidence indicates that the director exhibited duty of care.
Police do not always investigate all business torts. Professionals (doctors, lawyers, accountants)
purchase malpractice insurance. The Commerce Liability Provision is a fictitious term.

Perform certain activities or fulfill obligations. A court considers several criteria when determining if a
contract is valid. A valid contract is a mutually beneficial agreement between two parties in which both
parties promise to perform certain activities. Also, the contractual activities must not break any laws. A
valid contract does not require that the involved parties use mediation to resolve their differences, that
each party accept responsibility for all of the other party's actions, or that each party retain an agent.

Quotas. Quota programs often serve as unlawful infringement on the rights of majority groups, such as
white males. Businesses that institute affirmative-action programs should set goals that demonstrate an
honest effort to recruit minorities without establishing quotas. Title VII prohibits discrimination against any
group. Government contractors are required to have affirmative-action programs. Unions are not unlawful
and are not necessarily interconnected with affirmative-action programs, but instead have members from
majority and minority groups.

Many workers feel that genetic testing by employers infringes upon their privacy rights. Employee
privacy laws are often broad and many workers feel that some activities violate these rights. For
example, a business that requires a person to undergo genetic testing for health insurance coverage
purposes might infringe on a person's privacy rights. In addition, some countries allow employers to test
employees for drugs and workers believe that this activity infringes upon their rights. Many businesses
allow employees to access their personnel records. Employers often have legitimate reasons for
obtaining personal (private) information about their employees. Some information helps employers make
sure that employees can handle certain tasks (e.g., lifting). Businesses also release employee
information for government purposes (e.g., salary and taxation data).

Illegal actions. A whistleblower is a person who reports unethical behavior or actions. The government
developed whistleblower laws to encourage workers to report their employers' unethical and/or illegal
actions to the appropriate law-enforcement authorities. The whistleblower laws also protect the
whistleblowers from employer retaliation (e.g., job loss) for reporting the unethical or illegal behavior.
Financial activities, hiring practices, and business policies may or may not be illegal actions that
whistleblowers report.

Privacy rights. The growth of Internet use and e-commerce has led to many legal problems and issues
involving web-site visitors' personal information. Technology is growing at a rapid rate, which makes it
easier for individuals, businesses, and computer hackers to track a person's Internet history and
purchasing habits and then sell the information to other businesses. Because these activities violate
privacy rights, businesses must be careful to follow laws and develop and publish privacy policies for
posting on their web sites, which may reduce potential lawsuits. The specific example of collecting and
selling personal information from a web site is not associated with business-ownership options, patents,
or computer viruses.

Rules, forms, and decisions. Many courts maintain web sites so that residents in their jurisdictions can
gather information about the courts' activities and to gather routine information, such as telephone
numbers, contact (personnel) names, and driving directions. The content of the web sites varies, and it is
up to the court officials to deem what information is appropriate and necessary. The most likely
information that a court may post on its web site includes the court's rules, necessary pretrial forms that
lawyers need to complete and file, and court rulings or decisions (opinions) for various cases. Verdicts
are often posted but are often reflected in the court's opinion. Most often, testimony is not posted
because the jury might be sequestered or the information is too lengthy to post. It would be unnecessary
and inappropriate to post the jurors' telephone numbers on the web site without their permission.

Protect the competitive environment. In business, competition is the rivalry between two or more
businesses to attract scarce customer dollars. Antitrust laws are regulations that prevent a person or
company from taking any actions to restrain free trade and competition in the marketplace. Interstate
commerce refers to business activities that take place over state or principality borders. The purpose of
antitrust laws is not to restrain interstate commerce, increase stock values, or control tax rates.

To acquire royalties and elevate public knowledge and awareness. An author might authorize an outside
agency to use his/her work for the purpose of monetary gain or to raise public awareness. Often times,
outside agencies help to make authors famous through high levels of publication. Most likely, an author
would not license other writers to utilize material for criticism purposes; critics don't need copyrights to
comment on writers' works. Most writers do not want to give up copyright rights because this would allow
someone else to use and control their works. Usually, when writers authorize someone else to use their
work, they receive royalties in return; they do not usually authorize use of their work to establish a
reputation for sharing.

The employer. A copyright is the legal protection of books and other artistic works that the government
grants, and it gives the owners sole rights to the artistic works for a certain time. Under certain
circumstances, such as when an employee creates a work on the job, the employer owns the copyright.
This situation is covered under the "made for hire" provision and is part of the United States Copyright
Act of 1976. Therefore, the employee, the printer, and the directors do not own the brochure's copyright.

Employee signs an agreement that transfers ownership of the patent. Many businesses hire employees
to create or invent goods and services to sell. A patent legally provides the owner the sole rights of the
new product for a certain amount of time. When an employee invents a product as a part of his/her job
duties, ownership rights generally belong to the employer. To further protect the business's legal
ownership of the invention, it is best for employers to have employees sign an invention assignment
agreement at the time of hire. This agreement is a document that transfers invention ownership from the
inventor (employee) to the employer. The government issues patents rather than a trade association.
Applying for a utility patent does not automatically transfer patent ownership rights. A nondisclosure
clause is a statement in a contract in which the employee promises not to tell others (e.g., competitors)
about the employer's trade secrets.

Distribution of knock-off goods. Knock-off goods are products that look like well-known brand items (e.g.,
designer handbags, Rolex watches) and are sold at a much lower price. A government-issued trademark
protects a producer's symbols and designs from being used by others. A business with a trademark can
file lawsuits against others who are attempting to profit from look-alike items. Economic sanctions are
trade restrictions placed by one country against another country that is violating international law. Tariffs
are taxes on imported goods and are not necessarily illegal. Trademarks do not protect a business from
economic sanctions and tariffs. Licensed products are goods that carry the name or logo of an
organization that authorizes another organization to make and distribute the items for sale. A business
that authorizes an organization to use its trademark is usually increasing the level of licensed products,
rather than reducing them.

Revise its budget. A company that does not understand the legal issues and regulations that affect the
business may be unintentionally violating the law. Depending on the nature of the violation, the
government may penalize the company by ordering it to pay a high fine. Because the business may need
to take the money it allocated for different business purposes and use it to pay the fine, the company may
need to revise its budget. If the company lacks money for business activities because of the fine, it would
not increase its promotion or spending. The company does not necessarily need to revise its business
structure, either.

Enforced. Procedural laws are written rules that govern the way that substantive laws are enforced.
Substantive laws are written rules that protect peoples' rights and state their societal duties. For example,

prosecute a person who damages or steals property from the owner. Procedural laws do not define how
to negotiate, position, or resolve substantive laws.

Created a hostile work environment. If a plaintiff can prove that a business manager has intentionally or
unintentionally created a hostile work environment, the manager and/or the employer may be subject to a
lawsuit. To prevent harassment in the workplace, businesses should provide their managers with training
and information about appropriate and legal workplace behavior. Because of inappropriate behavior, the
employer often dismisses or fires the manager. Companies do not usually fire managers who follow
company rules and policies, understand goals and objectives, or refuse to engage in gender harassment.

Reach a mutually satisfying solution. Mediation is a process in which a neutral third party helps two
parties resolve a dispute. The mediator listens to both sides of the issue and tries to find common
ground. By finding common ground and working through the issues, a mediator's primary objective is to
reach a solution that satisfies the disputing parties. Arbitrators are appointed by a governing body to
make a final decision about a dispute. Binding arbitration decisions are not overturned because both
parties agree to adhere to the decision before the process begins. An attorney is usually hired to assess
a party's legal options related to a dispute, rather than a mediator.

Settled in civil court. Contracts are agreements between two or more people stating that one party is to
do something in return for something provided by another party. Contract law is a branch of civil law,
which addresses wrongdoings and private issues between two parties. Because litigation is very
expensive, a contractual disagreement is heard in civil court as a last resort, if it cannot be settled
through mediation or arbitration. Mediation and arbitration are methods of contract resolution that involve
neutral third-party intervention outside the court system. Appellate courts review lower court decisions
and focus on procedural issues. A grand jury is a group of people who review the evidence and
information about a situation or case. If the grand jury determines that enough evidence exists to
prosecute a person for a crime, then the defendant is charged with the crime.

Involvement of agents. Agents typically do not take ownership of a product. They are representatives of
the buyer or seller and do not take title to the goods. During the distribution process, either the buyer or
the seller owns the goods rather than the agent. Availability of the product, country in which the product is
produced, and the physical characteristics of the product are factors when determining the best physical
distribution path to follow. They do not determine legal ownership.

A is forcing Business B to buy its products. Outsourcing involves obtaining assistance from outside the
business to achieve the business's objectives. Bundling involves selling several products together as one

"easy credit terms." It is not important to use language that is graphic, technical, or flexible when writing

Narrow the topic. Proposals often are intended to explain and provide a solution to a business problem.
Before writing a proposal, it is important to narrow the topic because many problems are too broad to
cover in one proposal. An example is writing a proposal to improve the image of a business throughout
the world. For the proposal to be effective, the topic needs to be narrowed to focus on specific aspects of
the problem, such as developing an effective promotional campaign. It is not important to read the
business's mission statement or contact a research firm before writing a proposal. A summary is an
overview of the proposal that is prepared after the proposal is written.

Be the leader. If a business is large, each department often has regular staff meetings so the manager
can communicate important information to employees and keep them informed about current issues.
When participating in these staff meetings, the department manager is the leader—the one who runs the
meeting and keeps the employees focused on the agenda. As the leader, it may be necessary for the
manager to encourage employees to participate or prevent arguments. The manager usually appoints an
employee to record the minutes. Managers oversee and encourage the discussion rather than dominate
it. Managers should follow the agenda they set for the staff meetings rather than expand it during the
meeting.

should not allow one person to monopolize the discussion or let only a few people contribute. The

quality service. In order to concentrate on devoting their full attention to customers, they should avoid
becoming distracted by other things going on around them, such as coworkers' conversations or the
amount of work piling up on their desks. An impression is a sense or image that someone has about
another person. Emotions are strong feelings. An aggravation is an irritation or annoyance. Employees
routinely form impressions, feel emotions, and experience aggravations during the day, but they should
try not to let these things distract them from focusing on their customers.

Hiring too many workers. The law of diminishing returns states that, at some point, adding more
resources does not proportionately increase productivity. For example, adding more employees when
there is limited space and equipment will eventually have a negative effect on production because
overcrowding will occur and no one will be able to work efficiently. Businesses apply this law when
deciding whether to hire more employees because they do not want to hire too many workers. It is not
important for businesses to understand the impact of the law of diminishing returns to avoid
misinterpreting economic trends, paying high interest rates, or importing a lot of products.

However, this category is an indication that there is a problem in the economy because there are not
enough jobs for qualified workers. For example, a college graduate with a degree in marketing who is
working part-time as a clerk in a retail store because s/he could not find an appropriate job is
underemployed. The unemployment rate only includes those people who are out of work and actively
seeking employment. The unemployment rate includes workers who have been terminated. These
workers might be professionals or semiskilled.

Interest rates. Interest rate is the percentage figure used in calculating interest charges. It is the price of
borrowing money. When interest rates are low, individuals and businesses often borrow more money,
which increases the level of spending in the economy. However, when interest rates are high, the price of
borrowing money is also high. As a result, individuals and businesses usually borrow less, which
decreases the level of spending in the economy. Bank deposits, stock options, and trade barriers usually
do not have a significant impact on the level of spending in an economy.

Laws and attitudes. Rather than ship locally produced goods to foreign countries, many corporations
locate factories and businesses abroad. These companies must comply with the different laws and
attitudes of each nation in which they operate. Trade barriers are designed to limit trade by the use of
tariffs, quotas, and licenses. Inspection standards regulate the quality of the products that countries allow
to be imported. Balance of trade is the difference between a nation's exports and its imports.

Ethical. Satisfied customers often tell employees that they are pleased with a good or service. When this
happens, it is ethical to ask the customer to pass on that information to management. Favorable
comments from customers carry more weight than information provided by employees. In most cases,
satisfied customers are willing to write a short letter or make a phone call expressing their satisfaction.
Employees who ask customers to do so are behaving ethically because they are simply asking
customers to be truthful. Politely asking customers to pass on favorable information is not an example of
aggressive, questionable, or unfair behavior. This practice is common in business and intended to let
management know that employees are performing effectively.

Credibility. Credibility is believability. In order to convince others of your point of view, you need to be
believable. In this case, Brian's coworkers need to believe that he knows how to keep records before
they can be persuaded to try his method. None of the other alternatives would help Brian to convince
others of his point of view. Initiative is the willingness to act without having to be told to do so.
Passiveness is the failure to exercise personal rights and a lack of respect for personal needs.
Aggressiveness is the willingness to ignore the rights of and exploit others in order to achieve personal
goals.

Interests. The key to successful negotiation is to focus on interests. Interests are the things that you and
the other person want or need. You must consider the other person's interests as well as your own. Skill
is the ability to perform a task through knowledge, training, and practice. When negotiating, one person
may not necessarily know the other person's skills. Standards are specifications or statements that are
used as a basis for comparing or judging goods or services. A procedure is the step-by-step process
someone follows when performing a specific task.

To maintain productivity. Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension.
Excessive stress can have a negative effect on employees, such as reducing productivity. When
employees feel stress, they may not work efficiently. Also, stress may cause employees to miss work
because of stress-related illnesses. To maintain productivity, many businesses develop activities and
programs that help employees reduce stress. For example, some businesses provide recreational
activities such as exercise programs during the work day. Some businesses provide quiet areas for
employees to relax or listen to music. The intention is to reduce stress so employees will remain healthy
and productive. Businesses do not develop programs and activities to help reduce employee stress to
encourage creativity, eliminate conflict, or exhibit empathy.

Team building. Team building is the use of cooperative efforts among employees and management to
accomplish company goals and objectives. Many businesses have found that teams are effective in
finding solutions to problems because all members of the team feel a sense of ownership for the
decision. The members work together to identify the best possible solution, contribute equally to the
process, offer ideas and information, and share in the success. In many cases, the team has the
authority not only to find a solution but to implement it, which leads to a feeling of pride in the team's
accomplishments. Teams usually encourage and reward creative thinking. Project staffing involves
identifying employees to work on a particular project. Office restructuring involves changing the way a
business is organized, such as downsizing.

cultures of others, who may or may not share the giver's enthusiasm for certain holidays, music, or
entertainment. Recognition does not have to be something the giver would like to receive; the focus here
is on the receiver's likes and dislikes. It also does not have to inform others of the accomplishment. It
does not have to be something everyone can use, such as money or a gift certificate. In fact,
personalized rewards and recognition are better.

To be competitive. Businesses must compete with each other for customers. The convenience of being
able to buy now and pay later is often the deciding factor for customers when they are selecting a
company with which to do business. Extending credit to customers does not help the business to
purchase stock as needed. It may, in fact, make it more difficult since the business may not have as
much cash on hand to pay for stock as it would if its customers paid in cash. Extending credit is an
expense to the business, not a saving.

Verify credentials. When selecting a financial-services provider, it is important to make sure that the
provider is qualified. One way to do this is to verify the provider's credentials. In many areas, financialservices
providers must pass an exam or obtain a license. These credentials verify that the provider has
the necessary training and background to give financial advice, help develop financial plans, and make
investments. Although it is usually necessary to make an appointment to meet with a financial-services
provider, that is not an important step to take when selecting the provider. Individuals organize their
records before meeting with a financial-services provider. Planning an investment takes place after
selecting a qualified provider.

$67,500. The accrual method of accounting records transactions at the time they occur, even if no money
changes hands at that time. This method is used by many businesses, especially those that extend
credit. Since credit purchases are never paid for at the time of purchase, the accrual method keeps the
business up-to-date on the amount of sales rather than on the amount of cash received. If a business
made $25,000 in credit sales and $42,500 in cash sales in one month, accounting records would show
$67,500 in sales for that month even though the money for the credit sales had not yet been received.
Monthly sales do not include cash-on-hand or wages.

Communicate it to all employees. To make sure their budgets are effective, businesses should
communicate them to all employees. Even the best, most accurate budget is ineffective if no one sees it.
Effective budgets are those that have been clearly communicated to all employees, so that each person
in the company is aware of his/her effect on the company's profits. All employees should receive this
information, not just top managers. Businesses usually send annual financial statements rather than
budget information to their stockholders. Specific budget information usually is not posted on company
bulletin boards.

Marginal revenue. Marginal revenue, or the extra revenue associated with the production and sale of one
additional unit of output for a business, is determined by dividing the change in total revenue by the
marginal product. Businesses calculate marginal revenue to determine if they are earning the desired
amount of profit by increasing production and selling more items. The break-even point is the level of
sales at which revenues equal total costs. Earned income is the amount earned by an employee. Cash

To reduce turnover. Most businesses conduct exit interviews with employees when the employees are
leaving the business. The purpose of the exit interview often is to determine why the employee is leaving
and to find out if there are problems in the business that caused the employee to leave. Businesses use
this information to make changes in order to reduce the rate of employee turnover. If the turnover rate is
high, there may be a main cause, such as inadequate training or poor supervision, that the business can
correct in order to keep employees. Businesses do not use the information they obtain during exit
interviews to identify competitors, although businesses often ask employees where they are going.
Businesses do not necessarily increase pay because of the information obtained during exit interviews,
because pay is often not the main reason that employees leave. In most cases, businesses use the
information to make changes in order to keep valued employees.

by doing the job. Job rotation allows an employee to learn several related jobs, one at a time, until the
training process is completed.

Motivation. Motivation is the process of getting employees to strive to achieve management's objectives
because they want to achieve them. When an employee feels validated and that his/her work is important
and appreciated by management, s/he is more likely to be motivated to keep performing at the same
level or at a higher level. Informal recognition or praise does not usually distract employees or make them
feel apathetic (indifferent). Because some jobs must be done a specific way, an employee's flexibility is
not always affected by informal recognition or praise.

Increase in turnover. Simply listening to complaints is not enough. Businesses must take action to
resolve the employee's dissatisfaction. If action is not taken, a minor complaint may mushroom into a
major problem and cause an increase in employee turnover. If employees feel that their concerns are not
being addressed, they may decide to find employment elsewhere. Increased turnover is expensive
because it is costly to continually hire and train new employees. Besides an increase in turnover,
employee dissatisfaction may result in an increase in work slowdowns, a decrease in morale, and an
increase in employee pilferage.

Corrective. There are two general approaches to remedial action that supervisors can use: preventive
and corrective. Preventive discipline is essentially an approach to managing people in such a way that
behaviors which would require discipline are prevented. One action that supervisors can use to prevent
discipline problems is open-door management: a policy permitting employees to voice their complaints,
grievances, or problems to successively higher levels of management. Corrective discipline is intended to
discourage further violations after infractions have already occurred. It may consist of one or several
forms of action including progressive discipline, corrective counseling, and constructive criticism.
Termination-at-will is a policy that allows for the discharge of any employee without cause, provided there
is no legal restriction or contract which applies to the situation.

Make sure customers know how the information will be used. Ethical behavior involves doing what is
right. When businesses collect marketing information from customers, it is ethical to make sure
customers know how the information will be used. Then, customers have the opportunity to decide not to
provide information, or to provide only certain types of information. It is not ethical to mislead customers
in order to obtain marketing information. It may be considered unethical to gather data from only a few
customers in one area because the results will not be representative of the market. Customers have the
right to know who is sponsoring and paying for the research project. It is usually considered unethical to
sell customer information unless customers are aware of this practice and agree that their information
may be sold.

A new customer's check is for an amount larger than the purchase total. The customer's check may be
valid, or it may be a bad check because there is not enough money in the customer's account to honor
the check. If the business accepts a bad check, the bank will not honor the check, and the business will
lose not only the value of the customer's purchase but the additional cash as well. To protect themselves,
some businesses require checks for more than the purchase total to be approved by a manager. A
regular customer who brings in a new neighbor does not represent a risk to the business. Most

Solicit input from employees. Quality is the degree of excellence of a good or service. It is important for a
business's management team to monitor all aspects of the business so it can maintain or exceed the
quality level that its customers expect. If quality decreases, the business may lose customers to its
competitors. An important part of monitoring quality is soliciting input from the workers who are actually
performing the tasks, because they often have ideas that will help them do their jobs with more efficiency.
Ongoing communication is necessary for continuous quality improvement because unexpected issues
might occur that affect quality, and management needs to know so the problems can be fixed.
Continuous quality improvement usually occurs in small increments over time. The number of changes is
dependent on the business's goals. It is not always necessary to hire additional staff to oversee quality
control programs. The frequency of reports that management requires is dependent on the business's
needs, objectives, and procedures.

$2,363.85. When businesses negotiate long-term leases, they often negotiate the amount of increase
from year to year. In this example, the rent will increase 2% the second year. To calculate the monthly
rent for the second year, multiply the first year rate by the rate of increase ($2,250 x 2% or .02 = $45),
and add that amount to the first year rate ($2,250 + $45 = $2,295). The third year, monthly rent will
increase 3% over the second year's rate of $2,295. To calculate that amount, multiply the second year
rate by the rate of increase ($2,295 x 3% or .03 = $68.85) and add that amount to the second year rate
($2,295.00 + $68.85 = $2,363.85).

Lease equipment. There are many ways that businesses can control their operating expenses. One of
these is to lease equipment rather than buy it. Businesses often are able to lease equipment and pay for
it on a monthly basis over a period of time, which saves paying the purchase price in one lump sum.
Also, leased equipment can be returned at the end of the lease agreement and replaced with new
equipment, which often saves the business repair expense. Sometimes, businesses need specialized
equipment for a certain project, and it is more economical to lease it for a short time than to buy
equipment that will not be needed again. Buying in small quantities is often more costly than buying in
large quantities. Obtaining credit does not control expenses because a business must repay the loan with
interest. Organizing inventory space does not necessarily help to control operating expenses.

Below-cost pricing. When a company prices its products below cost, it makes it difficult for other
companies to compete with the low prices, which they cannot afford to charge, and might eventually force
them out of business. To prevent this situation from happening, many governments have laws that make
it illegal for businesses to use below-cost pricing. When a business charges one price for all items it sells,
it is using a one-price policy. Price skimming is a pricing strategy that involves setting prices higher than
those of the competition. Markup is the difference between the cost of a product and its selling price.

Accurate labeling. One way that businesses can include consumer protection as part of product/service
management is by labeling products accurately. Product labels protect consumers by telling them what
they need to know in order to use the product safely. The information provided should be as accurate and
easy to understand as possible. Discount pricing, creative selling, and precise marketing are not forms of
consumer protection.

Disclosure. When a business violates a government regulation, corrective action is the manner in which
the government requires the business to put right, or fix, the wrongdoing. Affirmative disclosure is a type
of corrective action in which the government orders the advertiser to include product information in future
advertisements that it omitted in its previous advertisements. An endorsement is approval by a reputable
external source. A testimonial is a statement by an identified product user proclaiming the benefits
received from the use of the product. A briefing is an update or status report.

97. C
What is the right thing to do? Sometimes, salespeople find themselves in situations that require them to
make decisions that are not clearly right or wrong. When this occurs, each salesperson must rely on
his/her own moral compass to make these decisions or take action. Highly ethical salespeople will do the
right thing, even if the result is not favorable for them. The remaining options are not questions that a
highly ethical salesperson usually asks himself/herself.

98. A
The customer files a lawsuit. Salespeople must be careful about how they communicate product
information to their customers. If a salesperson exaggerates or misrepresents a product's capabilities or
characteristics, and the customer purchases the product and it doesn't perform as the salesperson said it
would, the customer can sue the company for breach of contract. A salesperson misrepresenting a
product is more likely to be reprimanded or dismissed rather than promoted. A testimonial is an
endorsement. A referral is a lead that a satisfied customer provides to a salesperson. A customer who is
unhappy with a product does not usually endorse the product, or provide the salesperson with a referral.

Technical skills. Although many managers don't perform the specific tasks, they need to understand the
technical aspects of the business. They need to be able to answer questions, give directions, and solve
problems. If managers have the necessary technical skills, they will be able to help employees with their
jobs, such as counting money. Natural talents are aptitudes. Creativity is the ability to generate unique
ideas, approaches, and solutions. Aggressive behavior is conduct based on a willingness to ignore the
rights of others in order to achieve personal goals.

100. D
Unethical behavior. An ethical manager does not discuss an employee's confidential information (e.g.,
performance evaluations, health issues, personal problems, salary) with other employees. Ethical
managers treat employees with respect and do not share private information. Discussing an employee's
personal matters with others usually leads to distrust and morale problems among the company's
employees. Managers who share this type of information are not using sound judgment. Sharing one
employee's confidential information with others is not an example of impartial feedback or office
communication. However, it may be considered office gossip, which also may be unethical.
