1. D
Conduct. Conduct is the way a person acts or behaves. Laws are rules that provide a person with
guidance about appropriate behavior. Without laws, some people might behave in dangerous or
unethical ways. A person who is caught breaking a law can be subject to punishment (e.g., fine,
employment dismissal, prison sentence). Opinions and ideas are a person's thoughts that are generated
in the mind. Because people think differently and ideas are often subjective, laws do not necessarily
provide them with a model for appropriate thinking. Language refers to the way a person presents verbal
or written information.

 2. D
Trade. International courts consist of legal representatives from different countries (e.g., International
Court of Justice) who settle disputes about international trade. The decisions set precedent for future
trade disputes. Precedent occurs when a legal decision considers a legal decision from a previous case
that is similar in nature. Individual nations or locations usually establish election procedures for
themselves. Society is a general term that describes a group of individuals who share an environment.
Safety issues address danger, risk, or injury to someone or something. Individual governments,
businesses, or other international organizations usually handle lawsuits about safety issues.

To allow state agencies to make regulations governed by state legislation. Administrative law at the state
level is designed to operate within the codes of the state legislature. Administrative agencies have the
power to enact specific regulations within state law. Agencies cannot adapt state legislation to meet their
needs. Administrative agencies are not set up to repeal state laws. These agencies do not have the
responsibility of passing ordinances in cities, counties, and townships.

 4. B
Believes his/her rights have been violated. A civil lawsuit is a personal complaint in which one party
believes that another party has violated his/her rights by acting in a negligent way. For example, a person
who is injured in an accident might file a lawsuit against the person who caused the accident. A statutory
law is a written regulation that is approved by a governing body. When a person breaks his/her own code
of ethics, s/he doesn't necessarily file a civil lawsuit against someone else. An appeal is an action in
which a defendant requests that another court review a previous court's decision as it relates to his/her
case.

Are most likely to rule in favor of their clients. Jury selection is one of the most important processes for
attorneys; civil case decisions are highly affected by which jurors are selected. Attorneys need to assess
jurors' backgrounds, educations, relationships, attitudes, and employment. All of these factors can weigh
heavily upon jurors' decisions. Usually, court experience is not relevant for jury selections. Jurors who
have met respective clients would most likely not be allowed to serve on the jury. While serving the
courts in an honorable fashion is important, this is not the primary concern of attorneys.

Grand. A grand jury convenes to review the evidence and information about a situation or case. If the
grand jury determines that enough evidence exists to prosecute a person for a crime, then the defendant
is charged with the crime. The trial jury consists of selected citizens that listen to evidence and determine
the defendant's guilt or innocence. Discovery and preliminary are not terms commonly used to describe a
type of jury.

 7. A
Preponderance of evidence. A crime is a wrongdoing against society. To begin a criminal trial, the
plaintiff (government) must have sufficient proof that the defendant committed the crime. This proof is
called the preponderance of evidence. Before deliberating, the judge instructs jurors to determine the
defendant's guilt or innocence "beyond reasonable doubt" by considering the evidence presented during
the trial. Due process refers to a person's right to be heard in court. Doctrine of negligence is not a legal
term.

 8. B
State laws without local prejudices. It is important to know that federal courts apply state laws to try cases
that qualify for diversity of citizenship status. This is effective because the federal court tries the case in a
different setting absent of local prejudice. The federal court does not apply the laws of both states, but
only uses the laws of the state in which acts are committed. Minority status is not applicable in this
example.

 9. C
Probation. Probation allows a person to remain in the community but must report his/her activities to a
court-appointed officer. Because of overcrowding in the prison system, probation is an alternative
punishment for people who do not pose a significant threat to the community. A judge might require a
person to perform community service as part of a punishment in conjunction with probation. Volunteer
work occurs when a person performs activities based on his/her free will. If necessary, drug testing might
be a requirement of probation. An employer dismisses or fires its employees, not a court of law.

10. B
Criminal punishments often involve prison sentences while tort punishments do not. A person who
commits a wrongdoing against society is guilty of a crime. A tort is a private wrongdoing against another
person. Punishments for crimes and punishments for torts are different. A defendant who is guilty of a
crime receives his/her punishment in a variety of ways, which might include serving a prison sentence
and/or probation, conducting community service, paying government fines, or performing a combination
of these options. Tort punishments usually involve paying monetary compensation to the plaintiff or
stopping the activities that violate the plaintiff's rights.

that does not cause harm. For example, a person who drives at a very high speed in a residential
neighborhood is not following the basic duty of care. Empathy, control, and ethics are not widely
recognized terms that describe basic tort duties.

Reputation. Reputation is the way a business's customers, shareholders, vendors, and community view it
in terms of image and integrity. When a business is a defendant in a legal action, information might
reveal that the business behaved in an illegal or unethical way. As a result, the business might lose its
credibility with its public, which can negatively impact its reputation. Social responsibility refers to a
business's role and the attitude it has for the well-being of society and the physical environment.
Attributes are the physical characteristics of something, such as a good or service. Creativity is the ability
to generate unique ideas, approaches, and solutions. People, not businesses, have creative abilities.

Misuse of product. A manufacturer that sells a product in good faith and provides product use directions
might challenge the plaintiff's case by presenting evidence that s/he misused or abused the product,
which resulted in product damage or personal injury. Duress is a legal term that means exerting
unreasonable pressure on someone to take a specific action. When a person objects to imprisonment
procedures and policies, s/he files a legal petition called habeas corpus with the court. Circumstantial
evidence is data that is difficult to verify beyond a reasonable doubt. Although circumstantial evidence
might be an element that a defendant presents in a product liability lawsuit, it is not a type of defense.

Perform certain activities or fulfill obligations. A court considers several criteria when determining if a
contract is valid. A valid contract is a mutually beneficial agreement between two parties in which both
parties promise to perform certain activities. Also, the contractual activities must not break any laws. A
valid contract does not require that the involved parties use mediation to resolve their differences, that
each party accept responsibility for all of the other party's actions, or that each party retain an agent.

Mutual consideration. A contract is an agreement between two or more people stating that one party is to
do something in return for something provided by the other party. Contract disputes can occur when one
or both parties are not clear about the other party's expectations. Court judges who make decisions
about contract disputes often consider if the contract is beneficial to both parties, or contains mutual
consideration. Precedent refers to court decisions that are made on the basis of previous, similar court
decisions. Jurisdiction is the level of authority that a particular court has to try cases. Due process refers

Discrimination in the workplace. Discrimination is the unfair treatment of a person or a group based on
the person's or group's characteristics (e.g., race, religion, gender). Affirmative action is an effort to give
special employment consideration to disadvantaged groups. Affirmative actions do not necessarily
prevent businesses from hiring unqualified employees. The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) in the United States addresses health and safety issues. Affirmative action
programs should enhance workplace diversity, rather than prevent it.

A worker exposes information about the unsafe disposal of toxic waste by his/her employer. A
whistleblower is a worker who reports his/her employer's unlawful activities to a government agency or to
a media outlet. Some governments have laws in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation (e.g.,
demotion, dismissal) from their employers. When a person reports that his/her employer is disposing of
waste in an unsafe manner, s/he is a whistleblower. Filing a complaint about a neighbor's noise level is a
civil procedure, rather than a workplace issue. Plea bargaining occurs when a defendant agrees to
disclose certain information or conduct a certain activity in exchange for a lesser penalty. Generally,
witnesses to accidents are not in a position where plea bargaining is necessary. Laws restrict healthcare
providers from disclosing a patient's medical information. Whistleblower laws are not applicable in this
situation unless the disclosure breaks privacy laws and is reported by a healthcare employee.

Geographic boundaries. In many countries, there are many levels of government (e.g., local, state,
federal) that develop and enforce laws. For example, the state of Kansas might have a law allowing
businesses to conduct a certain activity while the same activity is illegal in the state of Mississippi.
Because laws are often complex and differ among locations and countries, it is often difficult to resolve
legal issues that involve web-based businesses because the Internet does not have or recognize
geographical borders. URL addresses indicate the page or web site an Internet user is visiting. Deep
linking is the practice of linking one web site deep within the pages of another company's web site. The
Internet can recognize URL addresses and direct users to other web sites by deep linking practices. A
shipping agreement is an agreement between two businesses that involves transportation specifications.

Review the other company's polices about linking terms and conditions of use. A link is a function that
transfers a web user to a specific page or place on the Web. Businesses often use links to connect a web
user to another organization's web site. Legal problems might occur if the business engages in copyright
or trademark infringement or violates a company's deep linking policies. To prevent legal disputes, it is a
good idea for a business to review the other company's linking policies before adding a link to its own
web site. Web-linking permits are not distributed by an international agency. Estate attorneys do not
generally develop contracts for Internet businesses. A product disclaimer does not relieve a business of
copyright infringement liability.

Evidence. Evidence is something tangible that proves or backs up a fact in a trial. If an e-mail message
clearly associates a person with a business crime, is obtained in a legal manner, and meets the
necessary criteria (e.g., authentic), it can be used as evidence in a trial. Hearsay is usually inadmissible
(unusable) in court because it involves statements that are made about another person. Testimony refers
to the answers a witness gives under oath during a trial. Perjury occurs when a witness lies during his/her
testimony.

Public corporation. A public corporation is a form of business ownership that exists when stockholders
purchase units or shares of the company. Because public corporations can sell thousands of shares of
stock to the general public, they are subject to strict tax reporting laws, dual taxation, and limited personal
liability. Limited liability partnerships, sole proprietorships, and general partnerships are legal forms of
business ownership that do not experience dual taxation. Dual taxation means that the corporation is
taxed two ways—the company as a unit pays taxes and each shareholder pay taxes.

Price fixing. Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which competing businesses agree on prices
of their products, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Pricing fixing also keeps smaller businesses
from being able to compete with those businesses that engage in the illegal activity. Therefore, the
antitrust laws not only protect consumers, they also protect other businesses from being unfairly pushed
out of the market. Monopoly refers to a condition in which one supplier controls a market and there are
no substitute goods or services readily available. Antitrust laws are in place to protect consumers and
businesses from monopolistic activities; however, the term equitable monopoly is not one that is widely
recognized in the business law field. International trade and sponsorship exploitation are not illegal
activities that are usually regulated by antitrust laws.

To acquire royalties and elevate public knowledge and awareness. An author might authorize an outside
agency to use his/her work for the purpose of monetary gain or to raise public awareness. Often times,
outside agencies help to make authors famous through high levels of publication. Most likely, an author
would not license other writers to utilize material for criticism purposes; critics don't need copyrights to
comment on writers' works. Most writers do not want to give up copyright rights because this would allow
someone else to use and control their works. Usually, when writers authorize someone else to use their
work, they receive royalties in return; they do not usually authorize use of their work to establish a
reputation for sharing.

Can appeal the decision with the agency. A patent is a legal provision that provides the owner of an
invention (process or good) with the sole ownership rights for a certain number of years. Patent
examiners have the authority to determine whether a good or process is patentable. Criteria for the
determination are broad but the general law requires that the item or process is useful, non-obvious, and
novel. An inventor that disagrees with the examiner has options to overturn the decision. The inventor
can appeal the decision with the patent agency. If the patent agency agrees with the examiner, the
inventor can take the case through the court system. The patent agency does not handle general cases
that involve contract disputes. Trademarks protect symbols and designs, rather than inventions.

Commerce. A trademark is a symbol, design, or word used by a producer to identify a good or service
and distinguish the good or service from products sold by others. Trademarks provide the producer with
legal protection if others use it without the producer's permission. To apply for a trademark with the
government, the item (e.g., logo) being trademarked must be used for commerce (business) activities.
Trademarks are often used in conjunction with manufacturers, in advertising materials, and production
processes, which are all business-related activities.

The plaintiff files a petition. A plaintiff is a person who believes that someone has violated his/her rights.
The first step in seeking restitution for the violation is filing a petition or report about the incident with the
appropriate authorities or agency. A defendant is the person who is accused of the violation or
wrongdoing. A counterclaim is a petition that is filed against the plaintiff for a wrongdoing related to the
same incident. A subpoena is a written document that requests a witness to provide information about a
case (e.g., deposition, court trial). An injunction is a formal legal request that requires a defendant to stop
a certain behavior that is related to an alleged violation.

Due process. Due process protects the defendant's rights by providing the defendant the opportunity to

action and just course are not terms commonly used to describe a defendant's rights during the legal

Death penalty. Laws are rules that govern a person's behavior. The purpose of a law is to create order

wrongful acts of others. Ethics are the personal beliefs that govern a person's attitude and behavior.
Sometimes, laws can contradict a person's code of ethics and can create controversy among people. For
example, the death penalty is a legal form of punishment in some places. Although it is legal, some
people do not believe that the death penalty is an appropriate form of punishment under any
circumstances. Most people with a reasonable code of ethics would believe that actions that cause bodily
harm to others (e.g., premeditated murder, armed robbery, physical abuse) are not appropriate behavior
in any situation, and therefore, do not contradict their beliefs and value systems.

uses to cover the business's expenses is often used to pay the fine. Fines do not necessarily result in
higher fixed expenses, increases in sales taxes, or decreases in insurance rates.

states that a defendant must stop engaging in a specific activity (e.g., sharing information with a
business's competitor). Mediation is a process in which a third party helps two disputing parties reach a
mutually satisfying outcome. Negotiation is the process of persuading or influencing someone to take a

To encourage research. A patent is legal protection of an invention or a process granted by government
to its owners for a certain number of years. A patent gives a business the sole right to make, use, or sell
its invention within that period of time. One of the reasons why the federal government awards patents is
to encourage businesses to do research and continue to develop new ideas and products. If businesses
have the sole right to profit from their inventions, they are more likely to continue investing money in
research and development. Patents protect the business that invented the product rather than the
consumer. A patent actually gives a business a monopoly on the invention for a number of years. Patents
are not a method of monitoring advertising.

common purpose to improve the terms and conditions under which employees work. Unions often form
when workers have a poor quality of work life. A referral method is a method of prospecting in which
salespersons ask someone they know or someone who uses the salesperson's products to recommend

$336,163. One of the main functions of an operating budget is to plan for income. Businesses want to
know that they are generating a sufficient income to make operating worthwhile. Budgeting for
anticipated increases in sales and expenses helps a business to budget income for the coming year. In
this situation, sales are expected to increase by 4% and expenses are expected to increase by 2%. To
calculate the increase in sales, multiply last year's sales by 4% ($582,500 x 4% or .04 = $23,300), and
add that figure to the amount of last year's sales ($582,500 + $23,300 = $605,800). To calculate the
increase in expenses, multiply last year's expenses by 2% ($264,350 x 2% or .02 = $5,287), and add that
figure to the amount of last year's expenses ($264,350 + $5,287 = $269,637). Subtract anticipated
expenses from anticipated sales to determine the amount the business should budget for income
($605,800 - $269,637 = $336,163).

Reduce operating expenses. Operating expenses, or overhead expenses, are the amounts of money a
business pays out in order to produce and/or sell its goods and services. Since operating expenses
include salaries and wages, as well as equipment, eliminating free services would reduce operating
expenses. The business would save the costs of delivery vans/trucks, the expense of packing for
delivery, and the wages paid to delivery personnel. This would not control inventory shrinkage which is

Misrepresentation. Misrepresentation involves overstating a product's capabilities or characteristics. In
some cases, misrepresentation is unethical because the salespeople's statements indicate the product is
better than others or the best when it really is not. Salespeople often describe their products in such
terms, and customers know those are the opinions of the salespeople rather than factual statements.
However, making such statements might be considered unethical if customers believe what the
salespeople say and buy the product on that basis. Carried to the extreme, misrepresentation may be
illegal. Breach of warranty and price discrimination are illegal rather than unethical. Exclusive dealership
rather than exclusive selling is illegal if it restricts competition.
