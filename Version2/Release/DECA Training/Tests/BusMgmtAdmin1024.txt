Rights of business. Many governmental agencies are responsible for enforcing rules and regulations that
are intended to protect the rights of businesses. Some of these agencies help to keep the marketplace
competitive and protect businesses' trade secrets and formulas from being stolen. The agencies often
develop a strong relationship with businesses in the process of protecting their rights. Governmental
agencies do not protect the barriers to trade, the target market, or the monetary policy.

Multi-level marketing. Multi-level marketing refers to a business, usually well known, that pays
commissions on sales earned to people at two or more levels. The sales representatives usually work
independently of the company. A product trade-name franchise is a franchise arrangement based on an
independent sales relationship between a franchisor and franchisee to stock and sell a specific line of
goods. It is also known as a dealership or exclusive distributorship. Licensing is a business arrangement
that requires the authorization or permission from an owner to another entity to use trademarked,
copyrighted (e.g., logo, name), or patented material for a specific activity, during a specific time period,
for the profit of both parties. Strategic partnering is not a term that is recognized as a method of business
ownership.

Past experiences. People often think they know what someone is going to say before they say it and as a
result do not listen well. People's past experiences may influence how well they listen because they think
they already know the answer or understand the explanation. Effective listeners try to block out past
experiences and focus on what the speaker is saying. Age differences, attention span, and language
skills are other factors that may affect how well people listen.

Giving honest responses. The three main reasons for active listening are gathering information, forming
an opinion, and connecting with and helping people. Giving an honest response is a good thing to do, but
it is not one of the reasons for active listening.

Having a pleasant voice. Verbal communication has a much more positive effect on listeners when the
speaker has a pleasant voice. Listeners are more likely to concentrate on the speaker's message than
they would if the speaker's voice is harsh, unpleasant, or irritating. Enunciating, or pronouncing clearly,
is important but should not necessarily be done rapidly. Mannerisms are part of body language, the way
you express yourself through posture, facial expression, etc., and these are not forms of verbal
communication.

Their names. Answering a business phone requires a more formal procedure than answering a personal
phone. People who phone a business expect to be greeted with the name of the company and the name
of the person who answered. Customers feel more comfortable dealing with individuals who have
identified themselves. It is not necessary for the employee answering the telephone to automatically
recite the address of the company, explain its purpose, or give the time of day to the caller unless
specifically asked.

Many opinions increase the chances of developing useful recommendations. Many businesses
encourage employees to participate in group discussions to analyze problems and find solutions. The
advantage is that when employees share many different opinions, there is an increase in the chance of
developing useful recommendations. However, the group leader needs to encourage participation, and
make all members feel comfortable so they will express their ideas and opinions. A disadvantage of
group discussions is that participants often tend to start thinking the same. Also, they may not want to
share controversial suggestions. Participants may be too willing to conform rather than express different
opinions.

Attractive visuals. The use of attractive visuals often enhances an oral presentation because visuals
make the information easier to understand. Also, visuals attract attention and help to keep the audience
focused on the message. Having charts, graphs, photographs, or slides helps to make the presentation
more interesting to the audience. Employees do not include written notes, detailed instructions, or coffee
breaks to make oral presentations more interesting to the audience.

schedule. A credit report concerns the credit standing of a credit applicant. An analytical report is a longer

memo containing a message for an employee.

Feasibility study. An analytical report provides evaluative information. A feasibility study is a type of
analytical report that explores the positive and negative consequences or the implications associated with
taking a certain course of action, such as changing vendors. A troubleshooting guide is a document that
provides guidance for solving problems with a product or process. An opportunity assessment presents
favorable circumstances that potentially benefit the business and is an element of a SWOT analysis,
which evaluates a business's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

Failing to accept responsibility for his actions. When you take responsibility for your actions, you accept
the consequences (good and bad) of your behavior, which is based on the decisions you make. Taking
responsibility for your actions often involves admitting and learning from your mistakes and trying to do
better in the future. In the example, Ned became defensive about a mistake that he made and blamed
another employee. By blaming another employee, Ned is failing to accept responsibility for his actions,
which were pulling and packing an incorrect item. Ned is not offering to correct the customer's order, nor

the business misrepresents its net worth to obtain credit, or misrepresents the cost of credit to customers.
Therefore, it is important for businesses to make sure they understand and follow the law with regard to

to post escape routes throughout the building. The finance function is responsible for determining how
company resources will be invested. Advertising and pricing laws are related to the marketing function of

Deadline driven. Establishing and stating deadlines is one tactic that businesses often use when
negotiating with vendors. By providing the vendor with specific deadlines (e.g., shipping orders within 24
hours of order placement), the business is making sure that its requests are met. Limited authority is a
negotiation strategy in which one party claims that s/he does not have the authority to meet certain
requests. Bargaining involves “give-and-take” tactics by both parties to reach an agreement. Silence
involves not speaking and is a good negotiating tactic to use when the discussion becomes heated or
when the other party does not like what is being said.

Increase net profit. Net profit is the money remaining after operating expenses are subtracted from gross
profit. Operating expenses consist of fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are expenses that do not
change with sales volume, while variable costs fluctuate with changes in sales volume. Therefore, if sales
increase without much increase in variable costs, and fixed costs remain the same, a larger net profit
should result. The cost of goods sold is independent of the relationship between fixed/variable costs and
sales. Break-even point is the level of sales at which revenues equal total costs.
