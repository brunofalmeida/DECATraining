Distribution. Business laws are rules that govern activities that involve the production, consumption, and distribution of
goods and services. The purpose of business laws is to protect consumers and businesses from the unfair practices of
other businesses. Expansion and contraction are stages in the product life cycle. A resolution is an outcome or remedy
to a situation.

2. A
Sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a universal concept supporting the idea that each country is of equal
importance with every other country—each nation has the right to manage its own government and develop its own
laws. Because each country structures its government differently, the laws vary from country to country, which makes it
difficult to establish international laws that apply to all countries, businesses, and individuals. Countries that value
equality and life usually develop laws that support the duty of social responsibility rather than injustice. Bilateral
estoppel and implied jurisdiction are not valid universal legal principles.

Medical bills. A person who is injured while on a business's property can file a lawsuit against the business when the
business exhibits negligence. In the example, the Pizza Palace does not exhibit reasonable and responsible behavior
because it fails to clear ice from the parking lot, making it dangerous for customers. Usually, when a plaintiff (injured
party) sues a business (Pizza Palace), s/he is requesting monetary restitution to cover medical bills that are associated
with the injury. Sometimes, a defendant is required to pay for additional damages to the plaintiff, such as lost wages
resulting from the injury. Usually, a business that is involved in a tort lawsuit is not required to pay for the plaintiff's
property liens, inheritance taxes, or traffic fines.

Plaintiffs and one defendant. A class action lawsuit occurs when a group files a petition together against a single entity.
For example, a group of consumers (plaintiffs) who have experienced similar side effects from the same medication
might file a lawsuit against the pharmaceutical company (defendant) that makes the medication. Class action lawsuits
do not involve multiple defendants and one plaintiff. Legal representatives are attorneys. Generally, there are two or
more attorneys involved in a single class action lawsuit because each party involved in the lawsuit usually has an
attorney to represent them. Pleading is the stage of litigation in which the defendant replies to the petition. There can
be many pleading actions during the course of a legal action.

Contempt. Contempt is a violation of a court's legal procedures or a judge's orders. For example, a judge has the
authority to issue a contempt citation to a person who disrupts court proceedings with rude or loud comments, because
s/he is interfering with testimony or distracting other people in the courtroom. A person who receives a contempt
citation might be required to pay a fine and/or serve jail time. Treason is an act of betraying one's country. Slander is a
tort that involves making comments that harm another person's reputation. Puffery is an advertising tactic that
exaggerates the ability or performance of a product.

Constitutional issues. The United States Constitution is the supreme law that governs the rights and responsibilities of
U.S. citizens. The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the land—all other courts are "inferior" to the U.S.
Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court hears cases and makes decisions about issues that affect U.S. citizens'
rights and responsibilities. Some cases the Supreme Court hears may deal with state authority, procedural laws, or
remedies, but these cases must reflect questions or issues that relate directly to the U.S. Constitution.

The Quinlan Company engages in bait-and-switch advertising practices. Many countries have laws that prohibit
unethical advertising practices. Bait-and-switch advertising is illegal in many countries. As a punishment for breaking
an advertising law, the court system often requires a business to pay a fine to the government. A business that hires a
consultant to conduct a tax audit is not breaking any laws. A business that sues a vendor for breach of contract is
involved in a tort legal action. Generally, tort laws do not punish guilty parties by requiring them to pay fines to
governments; they often must compensate the plaintiff (e.g., The Lloyd, Harris, and Dylan Partnership). A business that
charges service fees is not necessarily breaking the law if the clients know about the fees.

Embezzlement. A crime is a wrongdoing against society. An action is defined as a crime by determining if it violates a
law and by examining the offender's intent. Embezzlement is the fraudulent use of another person's or a business's
property, usually money. For example, if an employee steals or misallocates funds from his/her employer, it is
embezzlement. Embezzlement is a crime because it breaks a law and it is an intentional act. Defamation, unintentional
negligence, and breach of contract are concepts associated with tort law rather than crimes.

Responsible behavior. Under common law, individuals and businesses are expected to exhibit responsible behavior—
this is referred to as the duty of being reasonable. When businesses do not take steps to make their environments
safe, they are behaving in a negligent, irresponsible manner. Businesses that exhibit imprecise actions, indifferent
attitudes, or defensive conduct may be acting in a negligent manner. These are violations of civic duty.

designed to operate within the codes of the state legislature. Administrative agencies have the power to enact specific
regulations within state law. Agencies cannot adapt state legislation to meet their needs. Administrative agencies are
not set up to repeal state laws. These agencies do not have the responsibility of passing ordinances in cities, counties,
and townships.

Customer injury. If a customer is hurt (e.g., falling on a wet floor) while on a business's property, the business may be
legally responsible for compensating the customer (e.g., medical bills, lost wages) because the business was
negligent. Businesses can purchase liability insurance to reduce the risk of extreme financial losses due to
circumstances such as customer injury. A business purchases commercial property insurance for protection against
property loss. Credit insurance protects a manufacturing or wholesale business from losses due to its customers' debt.
Disability insurance provides a person with payment in the event the person is unable to work.

Breaches its duty to care. Duty of care is a principle supporting the idea that each person should use caution, watch
out for others, and act in a socially responsible way in a given set of circumstances. A person or business that
breaches the duty of care is not acting in a responsible way. Breaching the duty of care means that a person or
business is behaving in a negligent way and may be liable or responsible for a wrongdoing (e.g., injury). Duty of care
involves acting with reasonable intent, following specific codes of conduct, and attempting to obey local ordinances.
Businesses that do this are less likely to be subject to negligent liability.

Judges often make decisions for cases that involve oral contracts between two parties. A contract is an agreement
between two or more parties stating that one party is to do something in return for something provided by another
party. Although it is in the best interest of both parties to document a contractual agreement in writing, it is not always
done. Therefore, judges must often make decisions involving oral contracts. Arbitration occurs when a third party
makes a final decision regarding a dispute and each party agrees to abide by the decision. Legal decisions (e.g.,
implied contract disputes) are made by the court system. Contingency contracts usually consist of specific stipulations
for certain conditions and tend to be narrow in scope.

Death penalty. Laws are rules that govern a person's behavior. The purpose of a law is to create order within a group
or society, maintain a sense of fairness or equity among people, and protect them from the wrongful acts of others.
Ethics are the personal beliefs that govern a person's attitude and behavior. Sometimes, laws can contradict a person's
code of ethics and can create controversy among people. For example, the death penalty is a legal form of punishment
in some places. Although it is legal, some people do not believe that the death penalty is an appropriate form of
punishment under any circumstances. Most people with a reasonable code of ethics would believe that actions that
cause bodily harm to others (e.g., premeditated murder, armed robbery, physical abuse) are not appropriate behaviors
in any situation and, therefore, do not contradict their beliefs and value systems.

Encourage the hiring of underutilized groups of people. Affirmative action is an effort to provide special employment
consideration to disadvantaged (underutilized) groups. The advantages for businesses of using affirmative action
programs is that workplace diversity increases, which brings a variety of backgrounds and ideas to the business.
Affirmative action does not necessarily increase morale or productivity, or eliminate an individual's personal bias. The
purpose of the affirmative action program is not to decrease a business's dependency on technology.

Many workers feel that genetic testing by employers infringes upon their privacy rights. Employee privacy laws are
often broad and many workers feel that some activities violate these rights. For example, a business that requires a
person to undergo genetic testing for health insurance coverage purposes might infringe on a person's privacy rights.
In addition, some countries allow employers to test employees for drugs and workers believe that this activity infringes
upon their rights. Many businesses allow employees to access their personnel records. Employers often have
legitimate reasons for obtaining personal (private) information about their employees. Some information helps
employers make sure that employees can handle certain tasks (e.g., lifting). Businesses also release employee
information for government purposes (e.g., salary and taxation data).

Whistle-blower. A whistle-blower is an employee who reports his/her employer's illegal or unethical business activities.
To protect the employee from experiencing employer retaliation or backlash (e.g., demotion, employment termination),
governments develop and enforce whistle-blower laws. E-commerce laws deal with web-based business activities.
Antitrust laws address issues relating to competition in the marketplace. Discrimination laws are regulations that deal

Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction refers to the authority that a court system has to decide legal disputes.
E-commerce allows a company to conduct business transactions quickly and efficiently. Because different states,
principalities, regions, and countries have different laws and legal procedures, it is often difficult to determine who has
the authority to resolve disputes that relate to e-commerce. Presence is the physical location of someone or something.
Precedent occurs when a legal decision is based on a legal decision from a previous case that is similar in nature. A

Piracy is difficult to prevent in an easy-access environment. Because millions of people have instant access to the

the Internet. Finally, while it's true that many people argue for a free and unhindered flow of information, this doesn't
affect copyright law for the present moment.

Rules, forms, and decisions. Many courts maintain web sites so that residents in their jurisdictions can gather
information about the courts' activities and to gather routine information, such as telephone numbers, contact
(personnel) names, and driving directions. The content of the web sites varies, and it is up to the court officials to deem
what information is appropriate and necessary. The most likely information that a court may post on its web site
includes the court's rules, necessary pretrial forms that lawyers need to complete and file, and court rulings or
decisions (opinions) for various cases. Verdicts are often posted but are often reflected in the court's opinion. Most
often, testimony is not posted because the jury might be sequestered or the information is too lengthy to post. It would
be unnecessary and inappropriate to post the jurors' telephone numbers on the web site without their permission.

Public corporation. A public corporation is a form of business ownership that exists when stockholders purchase units
or shares of the company. Because public corporations can sell thousands of shares of stock to the general public,
they are subject to strict tax reporting laws, dual taxation, and limited personal liability. Limited liability partnerships,
sole proprietorships, and general partnerships are legal forms of business ownership that do not experience dual
taxation. Dual taxation means that the corporation is taxed two ways—the company as a unit pays taxes and each
shareholder pay taxes.

Eliminates competition in a free enterprise society. The Sherman Act is an antitrust law which encourages competition.
For a free enterprise society to be economically stable, healthy competition between businesses needs to exist. Pricefixing
means that businesses collaborate to raise, depress, fix, peg, or stabilize the price of products. Price-fixing does
not mean that particular businesses will monopolize certain markets. Competition is always good in a free market
society. Price-fixing often does not meet the demands of consumers.

Creative expression. Intellectual property is a person's ideas or formulas, which are intangible by nature and are made
tangible through creative expression. This creative expression includes numerical notations, scientific testing, words,
art, sculpture, processes, recipes, trade secrets, etc. People can protect their intellectual property from the
unauthorized use of others by registering with the government for a copyright, trademark, or patent. Intellectual
property does not become tangible through applied mathematics, scientific testing, or documented words.

Lobby their governments to impose trade sanctions on countries in which piracy is common. Misuse of copyrighted
material is a serious problem for businesses when other countries do not honor a nation's copyright laws. To combat
these practices, businesses and industry organizations can lobby their governments to take action against countries in
which piracy is a common practice. As a result of the lobbying efforts, a country's government knows about the
problem, and can apply pressure to encourage the other nation's government to take action to stop the piracy. Actions
such as trade sanctions and refusing membership into world organizations send a strong message to these nations
that the behavior of the businesses in their countries is not acceptable. The International Delphi Convention is not a
world organization that handles international lawsuits. A business that reorganizes its distribution channels is not
necessarily going to prevent international piracy practices. Piracy occurs when another person or company uses
copyrighted material without the owner's authorization. Licensing occurs when a copyright owner permits another
person or company to use the material.

Novel. Patent examiners have the authority to determine whether a good or process is patentable. Criteria for the
determination are broad but the general law requires that the item or process is useful, non-obvious, and novel. Novel
means unique, original, or new. A patent holder can file an infringement lawsuit against another party. However, it is
possible for the patent holder to lose a lawsuit if the court does not agree with the patent agency's definition of useful,
non-obvious, and novel. Patented material is not always concrete or intangible, but it must be either concrete or
intangible by being a usable good or a usable process. Patented material is not required to be universal.

Image. A trademark prevents others from using a symbol, design, or work that is used by a producer to identify a good
or service. A logo (e.g., Nike swoosh) is used to convey a certain image and create brand awareness in the
marketplace. By registering a symbol or design with the government, a business legally owns the symbol or design.
Trademarks discourage others from using the symbol or design because unauthorized users can be prosecuted.
Copyrights protect a business's information (e.g., formulas, literature, music). Patents protect inventions. Utility refers
to usefulness. A business can apply for a utility patent for a process that improves or increases a business's
usefulness.

Parol evidence rule. Two parties often have verbal discussions about specific points of a written contract before and
after signing it. When the verbal discussions differ from the written contract terms, disputes often occur. The parol
evidence rule provides judges with guidance in resolving this type of issue. The rule states that verbal agreements that
occur before the signing of the written document cannot be used to contradict the written agreement. It also states that
oral modifications that occur after signing a written contract are factors that the judge can consider, unless the written
contract states otherwise. Commercial disparagement, proximity of disclosure, and express claim provision are not
terms widely used to describe the legal issues relating to oral and written contract disputes.

Resource allocation. Resources are the things that are used to produce goods and services and to run a business.
Business resources might include money, raw materials, personnel, and vendors. A business that has legal problems
often moves and uses its resources in other ways. For example, a business might reallocate some of its profits to pay
for lawyers. Or, employees might take time away from their jobs to testify on the company's behalf. A distribution
channel is the route a product takes to reach the end user. A distribution channel is one of a business's resources and
is not always affected by a company's legal issues. Property value is the amount of money that something (e.g., land,
equipment) is worth. Purchasing procedures are the guidelines a business uses to buy goods and services. Property
values and purchasing procedures are not always primary business components that are affected by a company's legal
problems.

Knows about the employee's illegal actions and does not report them. Some countries have laws stating that a
manager who knows about his/her employee's illegal activities is subject to prosecution. A manager who authorizes the
illegal actions, covers up the activities, or does not use reasonable judgment in his/her supervisory role can also be
prosecuted. If a manager can prove that s/he is completely unaware of a subordinate's illegal activities, s/he may not
be legally accountable for the subordinate's actions. Generally, a manager is expected to be knowledgeable about the
company's policies regarding unethical behavior and illegal activities. Therefore, s/he is often liable for a subordinate's
wrongdoing.

Reach a mutually satisfying solution. Mediation is a process in which a neutral third party helps two parties resolve a
dispute. The mediator listens to both sides of the issue and tries to find common ground. By finding common ground
and working through the issues, a mediator's primary objective is to reach a solution that satisfies the disputing parties.
Arbitrators are appointed by a governing body to make a final decision about a dispute. Binding arbitration decisions
are not overturned because both parties agree to adhere to the decision before the process begins. An attorney is
usually hired to assess a party's legal options related to a dispute, rather than a mediator.

Injunction. A non-compete contract is an agreement between an employee and his/her employer stating that s/he will

must be upheld, an injunction is issued. An injunction is a court order that states that a defendant must stop engaging
in a specific activity (e.g., sharing information with a business's competitor). Mediation is a process in which a third
party helps two disputing parties reach a mutually satisfying outcome. Negotiation is the process of persuading or
influencing someone to take a certain course of action in order to achieve a desired outcome. Arbitration is a process in
which a third party makes a decision about a dispute between two other parties.

Real estate. A sales contract is an agreement between two or more people or businesses to purchase goods or

certain products to be documented. For example, the United States has a provision called the Statute of Frauds, which
states the types of contracts that must appear in writing. For example, the Statute of Frauds requires that a person who
is buying a house from another person must document (e.g., deed) the sale of the property. The nature of the sales
transaction (business to business vs. retailer to consumer) and the jurisdiction determine if the sale of nontoxic
chemicals, agricultural goods, and nonprescription drugs require written documentation.

Making an offer. The first step in developing a valid contract involves one party making an offer to do something for a

the second party can review it and decide whether to accept. A valid contract cannot be formed unless an offer is made
and accepted. The subject of a valid contract might be selling a product. Two parties might negotiate a price before one
party makes an offer to a second party. The party making the offer may set a deadline for the second party to accept or
reject the offer.

Restrain free trade. In a market economic system, individuals and groups own or control the means of production—the
human and natural resources and capital goods used to produce goods and services with some government
regulation. The basis of this economic system is to encourage competition and trade in order to maintain a strong
economy. Distribution activities (e.g., exclusive agreements) are illegal in some countries because they limit or restrain
trade. International trade involves importing and exporting products between two nations. It is important for businesses
to control their profit margins so they can compete in the marketplace.

Identify the audience. Before writing informational messages, business employees need to know who the audience is
so they can present the message in a way that is relevant to that audience. For example, one audience might be the

sends to customers is very different from the message that will be sent to investors. Before writing informational
messages, employees do not need to plan a response or wait for feedback. In most cases, the message will generate
a response or feedback from those who read it. The medium is the written message.

Interpret. One of the purposes of a complex written report is to interpret, or analyze, information that pertains to a

recommendations are made. Information is collected before it is presented in a complex written report. A complex
written report may contain unique or confidential information that a business would not want to publicize. Although
information is arranged in a complex written report, that is not the purpose of the report.

Sales. A proposal is a formal document that presents the reader with a call to action. When they are planning on
making large or expensive purchases, some businesses ask their vendors to submit sales proposals. Because the
proposal developer's goal is to get his/her plan implemented, a well-written proposal will tell readers the benefits of
purchasing their products. The sales proposal should also address how the products can solve the business's
problems. Finally, a well-written sales proposal should address possible objections that the business might have and
turn the objections into selling points. A research proposal is a document that involves selecting and analyzing data for
a specific topic. An instructor, for example, might require a student to submit a proposal for a research project.
Procedural and situational are not terms that businesspeople use to describe a type of proposal.

Unemployment. If a country is experiencing a time of high unemployment, it often relaxes the monetary policy to
stimulate economic growth. For example, interest rates might be lowered to encourage businesses to borrow money to
expand. As a result, more jobs become available and the high unemployment problem is eliminated. A country's easy
monetary policy is not used to correct the problem of high taxes, globalization, or import quotas.

Establish a desired level of production. When making decisions about production, businesses usually consider the law
of diminishing returns, which states that continuing to add workers when other resources stay the same will eventually
lead to a decrease in productivity. Therefore, businesses determine the most appropriate combination of all resources
and establish a level of production that will be the most profitable. For example, a business might decide that producing
500 widgets a day will generate the most profit given its current combination of size, equipment, supplies, raw
materials, and employees. If it adds another employee, production might increase slightly but profitability would
decrease. Businesses want to produce the number of products that will generate the most profit rather than as many
products as possible if that means less profitability. Businesses usually do not limit production to leave room for growth.
Businesses often try to increase production over time rather than producing the same amount from year to year.

Fixed costs. Economies of scale are characteristics that allow a business to increase output without experiencing a
comparable increase in the cost of production. The fixed costs of production remain constant so the overall cost of
producing more and more products actually decreases. For example, once an electric plant is built, the cost of
producing electricity decreases because the cost of building the facility is spread over more and more units of
electricity. In a business that has economies of scale, net profits may increase, which will lead to an increase in income
tax. Pay rates usually do not decrease as a result of economies of scale.

5%. The labor force includes those who are working or those who are unemployed but actively looking for work. The
unemployment rate is the percentage of the unemployed people in the labor force. To calculate the rate of
unemployment, divide the number of unemployed by the number in the labor force (8.5 million ÷ 170 million = .05 or
5%). The rate of unemployment is used to analyze the condition of the economy. A low unemployment rate indicates a
healthy economy because most of the people who want to work are working. On the other hand, a high unemployment
rate indicates a slowdown in the economy with fewer goods and services produced and many people out of work.

Recession. A recession is a six-month contraction in the gross domestic product. When interest rates continue to

increases. As a result, people have less money to spend, and the economy slows down. High interest rates do not lead
to expansion, a shortage, or a liability.

Countries have different resources. This is the primary reason that international trade takes place, or the buying and
selling of goods and services between nations exists. Some countries can produce some goods more cheaply than
other countries because of better access to raw materials, workers with special skills, or more up-to-date machinery. A
larger global economy and equal distribution of resources can both be results of international trade rather than causes.
Exporting that leads to increased employment is also a result of international trade.

Level of stress. Employees who set realistic goals and standards for themselves rather than expecting perfection all the
time are usually able to control and manage their level of stress. It is important for employees to understand that they
cannot perform perfectly in all situations and that they will make some mistakes. Being aware of this helps employees
to manage stress because they will not set their goals so high that they will often be unable to achieve them. Striving to
obtain perfection all the time increases stress and may cause employees to think that they are failures if they don't live
up to those expectations. Employees usually advance based on their ability to perform satisfactorily on the job.
Managers usually establish work schedules, and expect employees to work in groups when necessary.

Principal amount and interest rate. When people keep their money in a financial institution (e.g., bank), they earn
interest on the amount (principal) that they put into the account. The interest is paid to the customer's account by the
financial institution. Over time, the customer earns money on the principal by accumulating interest, which increases
the future value of the savings account. To calculate the future value of the savings account, it is necessary to know
the principal amount, the interest rate, and the length of time that the principal is in the account. Quarterly wages, late
fees, annual income, and insurance rates are not elements that will help a person calculate the future value of money
in a savings account.

The cash flow includes monthly expenses such as salaries and operating expenses as well as revenues from sales
and investments. In this example, the monthly sales and income from investments are added together to show how
much money came into the company during that month ($30,000 + $1,150 = $31,150). From that figure, subtract the
money that is going out of the company: $31,150 - [$9,500 + $14,250] = $7,400 cash flow.

Creditors. Creditors utilize the information generated from a profit-and-loss statement to review the financial status of a
business. Creditors are responsible for deciding if a business is granted a loan, or a cash advance, and want to make
sure a business has the cash flow to repay a loan. Top executives and managers use the information in making
decisions about operations and how to run the company efficiently. Investors would not be of concern in this situation
since the company is privately owned.

Anticipated expenses. A budget is an estimate of income and expense for a specific period of time. The purpose of a
budget is to help a company and each one of its departments control spending, set goals, and prioritize activities. The
person(s) who develops the budget considers many factors such as historical data—previous sales, salaries, etc.—
during the same period in previous years. When developing a budget, it is important to factor in anticipated expenses
such as professional development (training) and warehousing costs. Because each department has different needs
and expenses, professional development and warehousing costs are not anticipated expenses for all departments.
Business and departmental needs rather than personal needs are considerations when developing a budget.

Return on investment. Businesses often use the information in a profit-and-loss statement to determine if they are
earning a sufficient profit based on what they have invested. By comparing net profit after taxes with the amount of
money spent to earn that profit, businesses can decide if they are making a sufficient return on their investment. If the
return on investment is low, a business owner might decide that it is not financially worthwhile to remain in business.
Balance of payments is the difference between all monies coming into a country and those going out of a country.

Consider the demand for the business's product. Business owners often hire additional employees when they expect
demand to increase for their products. When a company expects higher sales, it needs to increase its outputs, and
therefore, needs more inputs (e.g., personnel) to satisfy the higher product demand. Business owners do not need to
obtain government application forms to hire employees. The business owner may not ask current employees to
increase their workloads because they may not have the necessary skills to perform the job. Once the business owner
determines that there is a need to hire an employee, s/he can advertise the position in the newspaper for outside
candidates.

the amount of income tax that the employees are required to pay. Businesses keep records of the salaries and
deductions to verify the amount the employees contributed and to explain the deductions if necessary. Information
about employees' salaries and deductions are not maintained in a business's accounting system, operating budget, or

able to plan future sales and obtain the products that will appeal to customers and encourage them to buy. Without this
type of information, businesses might have no idea what customers will want to buy in the future, or how much they will
be willing to spend. Businesses do not maintain records about what customers are buying and how much they are
spending in order to plan an inventory count, offer quality service, or develop a quality environment.

get rid of excess inventory or slow-selling items. Keeping these items in stock ties up money that the business could
use to buy new products that customers want to buy. Businesses do not monitor internal inventory records to obtain the

Guidelines to follow. To achieve quality in a business, management must develop a clear standard for employees to

what quality of service they are expected to provide to customers. Having a clear standard will give employees
guidelines to follow. Then, businesses need to check regularly to make sure employees are following the standard. If
the business discovers problems, it needs to take action and make corrections. Employees usually are not expected to
repair equipment. Businesses do not develop standards to achieve quality to provide employees with ways to stay
healthy or activities for being safe.

monthly rent, first calculate the cost increase by multiplying the percent of increase by the current rate ($2.50 x 4% or
.04 = $.10). Add the increase to the current rent ($2.50 + $ .10 = $2.60). The business will lease an additional amount
of space (800 + 125 = 925). Multiply next year's monthly rate by that amount of space to determine the monthly rent
(925 x $2.60 = $2,405).

Plan for the unexpected. When planning resources for an important project, a business's legal department should not

is often called "padding." For example, allow a little more time in case project members need to deal with other
activities. It is also important to be realistic. Businesses cannot always change their budgets, but they shouldn't try to
cut corners and get by with less than they really need. Getting resources at the last minute might cost more money
than expected, so being prepared is the best option. Not all businesses need volunteers to complete a project.

is trying to deceive consumers by using advertising, it often requires the business to pay a large fine. The purpose of
fines is to deter the business from engaging in the activity in the future. Governments do not usually issue fines for

Facts. Facts are true statements. During the selling process, a salesperson must carefully communicate product
information to customers, so that the customers do not confuse the facts about a product with the salesperson's
opinion. For example, when a salesperson says, "This product is the best item on the market," s/he is expressing an
opinion rather than stating a fact. If a customer purchases the product on the basis of this statement, and finds that the
item does not work properly, the salesperson and the business might be liable for misrepresenting the product. Skills
are abilities to perform tasks that are developed through knowledge, training, and practice. Incompetence is inability to
do a task correctly, and indifference is an attitude.

Organizing. Organizing is the management function of setting up the way the business's work will be done. It includes
identifying the jobs to be performed, assigning responsibility for them, establishing departments to handle the jobs, and
determining how many and which employees managers will supervise. Planning involves deciding what will be done
and how it will be accomplished. Staffing involves finding workers for the business. Controlling is the management
function that monitors the work effort.

Conflict of interest. Managers might encounter a conflict of interest if they are unable to be objective when making
decisions about employees. For example, if they are friends with an employee, they might not want to give that person
a negative performance evaluation even though it is justified. In those situations, managers should remove themselves
in order to be ethical and allow a manager who is not a friend of the employee to conduct the evaluation. Balance of
trade is the difference between the value of a nation's exports and its imports. Span of control is the number of workers
reporting to a manager. Return on investment is income received from an investment in a business.
