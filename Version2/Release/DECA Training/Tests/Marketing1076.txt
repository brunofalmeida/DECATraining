1. C
Contract. Contracts are agreements among two or more parties stating that one party is to do something
in return for something provided by another party. If one business promises to do something for another
business in return for receiving compensation, the two businesses have a contract. Then, the businesses
are obligated to fulfill their part of the contract. In most cases, contracts benefit both parties, although
promising to do something in return for receiving compensation is not necessarily a benefit. Treaties are
trade agreements among two or more countries. An enterprise is another term for a business.

Providing notice. Due process is the concept that the government must respect all of the legal rights that
are owed to individuals and businesses according to the law of the land. Legal procedure refers to the
methods and processes that are used to protect an individual's or business's legal rights. In many
societies, these rights include the right to be notified of accusation or lawsuit (providing notice), the right
to obtain legal counsel, the right to be heard in court, the right to confront the accuser, etc. Obtaining
witnesses is a pretrial activity. Awarding damages is a possible remedy or outcome of civil litigation. Due
process involves presenting evidence, not creating it.

Risk. Channels of distribution allow channel members to share risk. Moving products through a channel
requires financing and includes an inherent financial risk. Channel members do not share profits,
equipment, or employees.

4. B
Retailer. A retailer is a business that buys goods and sells them to the final consumer. Wholesalers are
intermediaries who buy goods from producers or agents and resell them to other businesses. Agents are
intermediaries who assist in the sale of goods but do not take title to them. Producers are growers,
providers, or manufacturers of goods and services.

Box or container. Radio frequency identification (RFID) involves storing an order's product information on
a computer chip and then attaching it to the shipment's box, container, or pallet. When a shipment arrives
at a business, warehouse personnel use computer scanners to receive the items quickly, which
increases efficiency. The computer chip is not attached to the delivery truck's antenna, the customer's
inventory report, or the receiving dock.

6. A
Coordinate a regional advertising campaign. Channel members are all of the businesses and individuals
that assist in moving goods and services from the producer to the consumer. In many situations,
producers will assist other channel members (e.g., dealers, distributors, retailers) in sales promotions.
One way to assist channel members planning a sales promotion in a certain area is by providing
resources (e.g., money, product samples) to develop an advertising campaign. The goal of the
advertising campaign is to communicate information about the sales promotion to consumers in order to
stimulate interest and sales. The producer may provide assistance by developing new products and
identifying market trends, but these activities do not relate to a specific sales promotion. An accounting
system refers to the methods and procedures a business uses in handling its financial information.

7. D
Strong leadership. A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to manage or avoid
conflict because the leadership has the power to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member.
Strong leadership has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and demand cooperation, which
reduces the possibility of conflict. When a channel has strong leadership, channel members work for the
good of the channel rather than for their individual goals. A channel of distribution does not need updated
technology or limited competition to manage or avoid conflict within the channel. Equal authority might
create conflict because there is no clear leader who has power and control over the channel.

8. A
Precise speech. Precise speech involves choosing the words that most accurately communicate what
you want to say. This makes your communication effective because it has clarity, and the listener will be
most likely to receive the message you want to transmit. Effective verbal communication should also be
tactful and should not include slang.

Supporting ideas with research. Ideas that are research-based are more easily accepted than those that
are not. Primary information is new information collected for the issue at hand. DiAnn is collecting
secondary information, which involves obtaining information that has already been collected by others.
The research does not create alternative ideas. It is meant to add validation to the original idea.
Clarifying an idea involves explaining it in more detail.

Offer to schedule a second call. In some situations, you will call an important customer at a time when
the customer is busy or in a hurry and is unable to speak to you. Then, it is appropriate to offer to
schedule a second call at a time that will be convenient for the customer. You should not try to continue
the conversation or explain that the call will be short if the customer indicates that this is a bad time. It is
your responsibility to return the call rather than ask the customer to call you.

Written. Written communication involves putting ideas, thoughts, and agreements into words and writing
those words in a document or letter. Written communication is often considered to be formal because a
copy of the information exists which indicates that all parties involved received the same message.
Businesses often use formal written communication in order to document important transactions and
preserve the information for future reference. Verbal communication involves speaking. Lateral
communication is between people on the same level. Upward communication is from employees to
supervisors or managers.

12. C
Are often seen by people other than the recipients. When writing e-mail messages to customers and
coworkers, the correspondence should address various business issues; therefore, writers should
develop the messages using a concise, friendly, and businesslike tone. If the writer uses language that is
very casual, personal, or questionable, there is a risk of offending the recipient or others to whom the
recipient forwards the message. Because many businesses have e-mail policies and can monitor the
contents of e-mail messages going into and out of their companies, e-mail writers should take care not to
send inappropriate messages. Business e-mail messages do not need to be entertaining or informal, nor
do they need to include graphics. Many businesspeople save important e-mail messages and flag them
for follow-up at a later time.

Makes the product appealing. Persuasive messages usually are intended to encourage someone to do
something. In the case of a sales message, the goal usually is to persuade a customer to buy a product.
In order to do this, the message should make the product appealing to the customer so the customer will
understand the benefit of buying and want to buy. The sales message should persuade the customer to
spend money. Persuasive sales messages are not intended to simply remind the customer of the product
or discredit the competition. Persuasive messages should not use loaded language, which is often biased
and stereotypical.

14. C
Being efficient. Being efficient demonstrates the customer-service mindset. Specifically, this means
knowing how to operate equipment and software, becoming familiar with all the products the business

People. Human resources, people, are the most important economic resource because they combine the
other resources to produce goods and services. Without the work of people, land would not be used to
grow crops, roads would not be built, and equipment would not be used to manufacture goods. Minerals
and energy are natural resources. Equipment is capital goods.

The earth has certain boundaries. Currently, the earth provides most of our natural resources. As the
population of the world increases, there will be more and more people living within those boundaries and
demanding more resources. Therefore, there will be fewer resources per person. Lack of training and
technology advancing faster than training are reasons for limited human resources. Natural resources are
found in nature, rather than being manufactured.

Freedom of competition. In a market economy, businesses are free to compete with each other for labor
and for customers. The government taxes the profits made by businesses and the money earned by
workers in order to provide services to the people. The role of the government in our economy is limited
to protecting private property, ensuring competition, and preserving law and order. Workers are free to
choose the type of work they want and are limited only by their own abilities and finances.

Increased interdependency. Increased interdependency means workers need to rely on each other. It is a
disadvantage of specialization. All of the other alternatives are advantages of specialization. Production
rates increase because the speed with which workers perform their specific tasks increases. Workers
become highly skilled as job tasks are performed repeatedly, and this results in increased efficiency.
Training of workers is simplified due to the limited nature of the tasks to be performed.

Indicates positive and negative trends. Price stability means that price levels remain fairly constant.
When prices are stable, they do not drastically fluctuate up or down. Price stability is one way to measure
the condition of a country's economy. If prices are stable (a positive trend), the economy is also stable.
Large upswings or downswings in prices (negative trend) indicate that the economy is not stable. When
the trend is negative, governments take steps to correct the problem. The concept of price stability does
not reflect the rise in wages and benefits, does not match the effects with the causes, and does not
compare revenues with expenses.

Personal information. Many businesses gather personal information about their customers that they store

Businesses should limit the number of employees who have access to customers' personal information in
order to protect the privacy of their customers and prevent unauthorized persons from obtaining and
using this information. A customer's telephone number, purchasing history, and identification code are
types of routine business information that usually are not considered to be private.

Dividends. Individuals and businesses acquire income in many ways. Dividends are earnings that are
paid to investors or stockholders for their investments. When Pedro purchased shares of Tabor stock, he
became an owner of the company. As an owner of the company, Pedro has the opportunity to earn a
percentage of the company's profits, which are paid to him in the form of dividends. Wages are the
income that workers earn for the work that they perform. Interest is the reward or cost of lending or
borrowing money, usually figured as a percentage of the amount borrowed. An inheritance is the assets
(e.g., property, goods, money) that a person leaves to others upon his/her death.

Furthermore, consumers have no guarantee that the business will keep the personal data confidential. In
some cases, businesses try to obtain this information in order to sell it to others. Most businesses follow
ethical procedures when obtaining marketing information about consumers. These procedures might
include conducting a random survey, sending questionnaires to a specific audience, and developing a

development, and expansion. Businesses can use this information to develop similar products or to
expand their sales area. Economic factors involve the state of the local economy. Regional data include
geographic and demographic information about the area. Buying motives are the reasons or benefits that

numerical mode. Open-ended questions are designed so that respondents react to questions in a
manner that requires more than "yes" or "no" as an answer. Because possible responses are not
controlled or limited, coding is often more difficult. If businesses are not able to assign codes to the
responses, the survey results may be extremely difficult to evaluate. The results of surveys that contain
open-ended questions are not difficult to store for future use, to enter into a database, or to distribute to
management.

Conducting exploratory research. Exploratory research is marketing research that collects information to
help the business define its issue, situation, or concern and decide which direction to go in order to
address it. Surveys that consist of open-ended questions require respondents to provide more than a
yes or no answer. An open-ended question is a type of unstructured question that allows a respondent
the opportunity to express opinions, state issues, and provide ideas. By obtaining this type of in-depth,
qualitative information, the researcher may be able to define the problem and determine in which
direction to proceed with the research. Long and technical surveys tend to overwhelm the respondents;
so open-ended questions may not be answered fully, if at all. The use of open-ended questions yields
subjective responses.

To ward off problems. Businesses conduct situational analyses to obtain information about changes or

businesses to identify changes at an early stage and ward off potential problems. It is important for
businesses to understand changes in their external environment in order to adapt and avoid problems.
Without this information, businesses may be unprepared to deal with problems that might cause them to
lose their competitiveness or even fail. A business would not conduct a situational analysis to identify
customers, forecast expenses, or redesign products. However, a business might redesign products after
conducting a situational analysis and finding that they were losing their appeal in the marketplace.

Migration. Migration is a population trend that indicates movement of people throughout the country as
well as into and out of the country. Migration trends are important to businesses because businesses

and migrating to what is considered the Sunbelt. This movement affects businesses because the types of
products they sell and the way they sell them will change. Also, the increased migration of ethnic groups
into the country creates a need for new goods and services that meet the needs of a multicultural
population. Lifestyle, consumption, and behavior are not population trends; however, these factors also
affect how businesses market their goods and services.

low quality. Also, the business might decide to cut corners in the production process to save money. The
result is low-quality products. However, it is unethical if the business does not make it clear to customers

Computer systems. Company information is a type of intangible property that most businesses want to
protect. Today, most of this information is stored on internal computer networks or systems. As a result,
businesses establish rules to control access to computer systems to protect confidential or sensitive
company information from being stolen or destroyed. Employees are expected to follow the rules, such
as regularly changing passwords or not opening suspicious e-mails, to help protect the information.
Protecting company information and intangibles does not involve following the rules established to control
access to inventory methods, cash registers, or storage facilities. The inventory kept in storage facilities
and the money in cash registers are tangibles rather than intangibles.

Production. Production is the creation of goods or services from economic resources. Promotion
communicates information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome.
Purchasing involves the planning and procedures necessary to obtain products for use in the operation of
a business. Distribution is responsible for moving, storing, locating, and/or transferring ownership of
goods and services.

Reduce operating expenses. Operating expenses, or overhead expenses, are the amounts of money a
business pays out in order to produce and/or sell its goods and services. Since operating expenses
include salaries and wages, as well as equipment, eliminating free services would reduce operating
expenses. The business would save the costs of delivery vans/trucks, the expense of packing for
delivery, and the wages paid to delivery personnel. This would not control inventory shrinkage which is
caused by employee theft and shoplifting. It would be likely to decrease customer satisfaction and to
make the business less competitive if its competitors do offer free delivery.

Protect the health of customers/clients. Public restrooms are a breeding ground for fungi, bacteria, and
germs that are harmful to people. Regular, thorough cleaning helps to keep these elements under control
and to protect the health of all who use the restrooms. Keeping restrooms clean does make them look
better, helps to preserve the fixtures, and may create a good image. However, none of these reasons is
as important as sanitation.

Select. The first step in achieving goals is to choose one that is meaningful to you. You may want to start
with a single goal or a set of goals. Before you can reach a goal, you must have a clear idea of your goal
from the beginning in order to achieve it. To complete or to fulfill a goal is to achieve it. It is not necessary
to adjust an appropriate goal.

Forced association. Forcing associations means making a connection between two things where an
obvious connection doesn't already exist. By forcing associations, you make yourself think differently,
which results in more creativity. For example, making associations with the color yellow might result in
developing connections with taxis, school buses, daisies, bumblebees, the sun, etc. Cooperation is
working together toward a common goal. Implementation is carrying out an idea or activity. Manipulation
involves controlling or managing people or circumstances.

Friends. Letting friends and acquaintances know that you are looking for a job is one of the most effective
methods of locating job leads. These people often will be willing to pass on information about new
openings, resignations, and retirements they learn about. Retirees, nonworkers, and minors usually are
out of the mainstream of the employment scene and would not have information concerning job leads.

Former employers. The reference section of a resume should list two or three people who can provide
information about you. The best references are former employers, because they can accurately describe
your work habits, abilities, and attitudes towards the job. Prospective employers will want to contact these
references to find out if you performed satisfactorily in former positions. Potential employers usually do
not want to contact your classmates, family members, and coworkers because they are personal
references who may be unable to provide unbiased information about you.

Voluntary. A chamber of commerce is an organization that supports businesses and business growth in
the community. It also helps local businesses resolve common problems. Membership is voluntary, not
required or necessary. Member businesses often display their membership plaques because they feel it
benefits them for customers to know they are part of the organization.

Socially responsible. Social responsibility is the duty of business to contribute to the well-being of society.
Businesses are being socially responsible if they refuse to take advantage of unfortunate situations, such
as damage caused by natural disasters, by raising the prices of goods and services that people need in
order to rebuild. Businesses that focus on contributing to society usually build goodwill within the
community and develop long-term relationships that are far more profitable than the quick money they
earn by raising prices during a disaster. Therefore, refusing to raise prices is not economically unsound
because the business will profit in the future from its responsible actions. Refusing to raise prices during
a natural disaster is not a political or legal issue.

Internet. More than a new way to take orders and deliver merchandise, the Internet has proven valuable

provides customers with more information about more products in less time than they can obtain from
making telephone calls or by reading the newspaper or a catalog.

To get a fair share of the market. Gaining market share is often an important pricing goal. Businesses
may lower prices in order to attract new customers and increase their market share. This could create
goodwill in the community, but that is not the purpose of the tactic. Price levels are not used to attract
employees. Competitors' activities would be tracked before prices were set.

To eliminate some ideas. Screening ideas for new products is intended to eliminate obviously bad ideas
and recognize the value of good ideas. It is a quick look at ideas to see if they have value, not a careful
or thorough analysis. New ideas must already be generated before screening can occur. Market research
would be done to determine if consumers will purchase the good or service.

Internet. The Internet allows businesses in the travel, hospitality, recreation, and insurance industries to
bypass intermediaries (agents and brokers). Consumers can easily go directly to the service business to
make the purchase. This enables the businesses to reach more customers and sell at any time of the day
or night. Fax machines are widely used as a means of sending information quickly rather than as a
selling tool. Key card entry systems are used mainly in the hospitality industry. Interactive television is not
as widely used by consumers as the Internet.

Trend research. Identifying product opportunities often involves research. One type of research is trend
research to find out the general direction in which people or events are moving. For example, trend
research might indicate that people want smaller cars or larger televisions. As a result of trend research,
businesses are often able to identify product opportunities. Once the opportunity is identified, businesses
usually analyze the idea. If the idea is feasible, businesses may conduct trial runs and production tests.

Standards. Standards are statements that specify a product's size, contents, and/or quality. Grades are
ratings that tell to what extent the standards are met. Warranties are promises made by the seller to the
consumer that the seller will repair or replace a product that does not perform as expected. Testimonials
are statements by an identified user of a product, proclaiming the benefits received from the use of the
product.

Replace or repair a faulty product. A warranty is a promise made by the seller to the consumer that the
seller will repair or replace a product that does not perform as expected. A full warranty provides that if
the product does not work properly, is defective, or does not live up to the warranty, it must be made
good within a reasonable time. The company providing the warranty may not put time limits on any
implied warranties the product may have. A limited warranty would only cover specific parts rather than
the whole product. Most warranties state that improper use or handling of the product will void the
warranty.

Business selling computer, printer, and scanner as a unit. Product bundling involves combining several
products and offering them to customers as one product. Usually, the bundled products are offered for
one, all-inclusive price. An example is a business selling a computer, a printer, and a scanner as a unit.
In many cases, the bundle is less expensive than the cost of each item sold separately. Sometimes, the
products can only be purchased as a unit and are not available separately. A lumber company selling
wood chips as small-animal bedding is an example of selling by-products. A theme park charging
admission and then selling ride tickets is an example of two-part pricing. A garden shop discounting
prices of seasonal merchandise is an example of adjusting prices.

Competitive advantage. Businesses often gain a competitive advantage over competitors by offering
customers a value or benefit that their competitors do not provide. If a business offers the best quality
and service at a reasonable price, it has a competitive advantage over competitors that provide lower
quality or higher prices. When businesses position themselves as providers of quality and service,
customers often think of them in those terms and prefer to buy from those businesses. Businesses do not
gain promotional consideration, geographic benefits, or marketing incentives by positioning products as
the ones offering the best quality and service for the price.

Licensing. Licensing allows a brand name to be used by another company for a fee. Brand positioning
attempts to create a certain image or impression of a brand as compared to competitive brands. Brand
extension is the use of successful brands to launch new brands. Brand repositioning reevaluates and

Identity. Corporate branding refers to the combined impressions, images, or experiences associated with
a company or parent entity. A corporate brand may include a variety of products, but the name or
corporate brand provides all products with a common identity. For example, PepsiCo is a corporate brand
under which its Pepsi, Quaker Oats, Tropicana, Gatorade, and Frito Lay products are sold. Corporate
brands do not necessarily provide a common platform, ranking, or strategy for products.

Purchases. Promotion is the communication of information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas
to achieve a desired outcome. Businesses use promotion to inform buyers about goods and services in
order to encourage them to buy. By purchasing the goods or services, buyers give feedback to senders.
Buyers let the senders know that they received the promotional message and respond by making
purchases. A complaint is a customer's expression of a dissatisfaction. A suggestion is a
recommendation. Referrals are individuals or businesses to whom salespeople are recommended.

Exaggerating a product's attributes in an advertisement. When a business exaggerates a product's
attributes or benefits, such as stating that a product is the best or that it can work miracles, the
business is engaging in puffery. This practice is an unethical advertising practice because it is misleading
and provides unproven information. Developing an advertising campaign about environmental issues,
using testimonials in print advertising, and placing product pricing in an advertisement are ethical actions.

Incarceration. While the penalties upon marketers who run false or deceptive advertisements may be
severe, these marketers are rarely criminally charged or sentenced to jail time. A cease and desist order
requires marketers to stop running the offensive advertisements. If these same marketers run false or
deceptive ads in the future, regulators may impose monetary fines on the marketers. If regulators
determine that a company is running deceptive advertising, that company may be required to run
corrective advertising.

Word-of-mouth communication. This is promotion and publicity for a business provided by customers
who tell others of their satisfaction with the business. Therefore, customers recommending the business
to their friends is an example of word-of-mouth communication. In many cases, these recommendations
lead to additional sales because people tend to believe their friends and take their advice. A testimonial is
a statement by an identified user of a product proclaiming the benefits received from the use of the
product. Verbal assertiveness is a confident attitude that involves the use of words. Recommending a
business to friends is not an example of one-on-one selling.

Public relations. Public relations is a function of business designed to establish good relations between

Businesses often hold press conferences and give interviews to communicate information and pass on
positive news about the business. Corporate management involves managing the business. Personal
selling is the form of promotion that determines client needs and wants and responds through planned,
personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and enhances future business
opportunities. Target marketing is the identification and selection of markets for a business or for a
product.

Logotype. The logotype is the name and/or symbol used by a business. Businesses believe that having a

The logotype clearly identifies the product's brand or advertiser to consumers. An illustration is a
photograph, drawing, painting, or graphic such as a chart, table, or graph. A headline is text set in large
type and usually positioned at the top of an advertisement. A photograph is an illustration.

Coordinating speaking engagements for employees. The public-relations department is a division of a
business that is responsible for establishing good relations between the business and its publics. The
various publics include the business's target market, its stakeholders, the local business community, its
employees, and local residents. One activity that a public-relations department coordinates is speaking
engagements for the business's employees. For example, a local civic group might ask the publicrelations
department if a member of the business's executive-management staff could speak to the group
about a particular issue that is affecting the community. The public-relations department would work with
the appropriate employee to schedule the speaking engagement. The research and development
department conducts product research and develops product prototypes. Developing job descriptions is a
human-resources activity. The advertising department selects media for the business's advertising.

Pass on positive information. One of the main functions of a business's public-relations activities is to
reach external audiences, those groups that are outside of the company. These groups include the local
community, government officials, customers, suppliers, creditors, etc. The external audience has a
significant impact on the business because customers buy products, government officials enact rules and
regulations, and creditors loan money. If the business does not maintain good relations with the external
audience by providing positive information, it may have difficulty operating or even fail. Public-relations
activities are not intended to sell useful products, measure the community response, or compile customer
databases.

Strategy. A promotional plan is the framework for the promotional activities of a business. The
promotional plan includes several components. The strategy component provides information as to
exactly how the business will achieve its established goals. The budget component outlines the financial
resources the business will need to carry out the promotional activities. The situation analysis is a
determination about the company's current business situation and the direction in which the business is
headed. A promotional plan's evaluation component provides information about how the business will
determine if its promotional activities are successful.

Product displays. Product displays are the ways in which goods and services are visually presented to
prospective buyers. Businesses often display products in windows, on racks and tables, etc. Businesses
often discount products and promote (advertise) these discounts to attract customers and stimulate
sales. To encourage customers to buy during the sales event, the business should display the advertised
products in an attractive way because customers are usually more willing to buy when the products are
organized in a visually appealing manner. Marketing research is the systematic gathering, recording, and
analyzing of data about a specific issue, situation, or concern. Stock handling is the loading, unloading,
and movement of goods. Marking down merchandise is a pricing activity rather than a promotional
activity.

explain those terms in plain English. Some goods and services require a technical explanation, and

To communicate with customers. An electronic data interchange (EDI) is a computerized information
system. This technology allows a business's computers to communicate with customers' computers and

automatically place orders when inventory reaches a certain level. The system facilitates the sales
process, which usually results in more satisfied customers and more sales for the business. Businesses
do not use electronic data interchange systems to identify potential accounts, fax sales data to
employees, or access competitors' web sites.

Benefits. Benefits are the advantages that the product provides. Effective salespeople know that
customers do not buy the product itself; rather, they are buying what the product can do for them. For
example, customers do not buy weight-lifting equipmentthey buy the ability to workout in the privacy of
their own homes. Therefore, the salesperson must translate the features (characteristics) of the product
into benefits. A customer does not purchase a product because of a person's attitude.

To have realistic expectations for workers. Even though managers don't do the actual jobs, it is important
for managers to understand the jobs of the workers they supervise. This helps managers to know how
workers should do the work, to be realistic in the amount of work they expect workers to complete, or
even to fill in when workers are absent or there is an emergency situation of some kind. Managers do not
need to know how to do the work to establish a chain of command. Coordinating employees' efforts and
creating a team spirit are managerial responsibilities that improve the output of workers but are not
related to managers' knowledge of the jobs to be done.
