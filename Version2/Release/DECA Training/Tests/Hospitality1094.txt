 1. A Violates a statute. If the contract involves carrying out illegal activities, the contract is unenforceable because it requires one or both parties to break laws. Unilateral contracts are contracts that involve promises made by one party. Collateral is anything of value belonging to the borrower that is pledged to the lender to guarantee that the loan (contract) will be repaid. A stipulation is a restriction or circumstance that one party requires the other party to agree to. Unilateral contracts and contracts that require collateral or other stipulations are legal if the contract meets all of the features of legal contracts (agreement, consideration, capacity, genuineness of assent, and legality of purpose).

  2. B Protect natural resources. The primary purpose of environmental regulations is to protect natural resources, including the air, soil, and water. Environmental laws require businesses to control the amount and type of pollution they release into the environment and to use appropriate measures for the disposal of hazardous waste. By following environmental regulations, businesses are complying with the government's efforts to protect natural resources by keeping air, soil, and water safe for consumption. Antitrust laws prevent monopolies, which are conditions that reduce competition in the marketplace. Encouraging business development and safeguarding business structures are not the primary purpose of environmental laws. SOURCE: BL:073 SOURCE: McAdams, T., Neslund, N., & Neslund, K. (2007). Law, business, and society (8th ed.)  [pp. 664-666]. Boston: McGraw-Hill/Irwin.  
  3. C Vary according to region and type of business. The rules that apply to travel sales vary by legislative jurisdiction as well as by type of business. While there are some national sales regulations that apply to the travel industry in the United States, customers' specific rights depend on the laws that apply in the city, state, or country in which a transaction occurred, as well as the kind of goods or services purchased. Professional associations in the travel industry are a good place to turn for information on laws that apply to a specific travel professional's activities. Customers who purchase travel goods or services have rights regardless of purchase price. Travel products do not come with warranties, making trip insurance an important option for customers.

  4. A Radio frequency identification (RFID).  A radio frequency identification (RFID) tag is a small computer chip that is attached to the item. The tag contains product information such as price, style, model number, etc., and allows channel members to track the item's movements from the time it leaves the production line to the point of purchase. The tag allows channel members to know where the product is at all times. Universal product codes are bar-coded tags that are read by a scanner. Supplier performance index is a method to measure and evaluate a channel member's performance. A global transit mapping system, universal product codes, and the supplier performance index are not forms of technology that track a product's movement through the supply chain.

  5. C Available when customers want it. Businesses usually coordinate distribution with other marketing functions, such as promotion. One reason why it is important to coordinate the distribution and promotion of a new product is to make sure that the product is available when customers want it. If businesses promote products but those products are not available when promised, customers may decide to buy from competitors. Most products do not appeal to all customers. Businesses do not coordinate the distribution and promotion of a new product in order to make sure that it is designed to appeal to a target market or is competitively priced.

  6. A Reading. The first step in applying written directions to achieve tasks usually involves reading the directions. Employees need to understand the written directions before they can apply them. Therefore, reading for understanding and meaning is an important step. Employees should listen if the directions are given verbally rather than in writing. If employees do not understand the written directions, they might speak to a manager and ask questions for clarification. However, they should first read the directions.

  8. B Ask questions to clarify other participants' comments.  Asking clarifying questions assists the entire group in learning about the topic.  No one in the group knows everything about the topic.  Talking together through tough subjects and sharing diverse viewpoints is the purpose of working as a group. Similarly, she should attempt to assist the group that she has been chosen for instead of asking to be removed.  This is not the right time to take a leadership role, which should be assumed by the person who knows the most aboutor has the most experience withthe subject.

  9. C Note cards. Speakers often write brief notes on small cards to help them remember to discuss important points they want to present to the audience. Flash cards contain important information; however, they are most often used to help someone study or retain information for a test or exam. Storyboards are pieces of paper with frames containing script information for television or radio commercials. People place important information that they need to remember on memo boards. Memo boards are often placed near workstations or telephones, and are not tools that speakers use during a presentation.

 10. A Regards. A closing is the point in which the writer ends a letter with a word of farewell just before signing his/her name. When writing business letters, closings are usually neutral, professional, and friendly. Closings such as  "regards" and "sincerely" are common ways to end business letters. THX is an initialism that represents the word thanks. Initialisms are not appropriate to use to close formal business letters. A writer might use "greetings" to open an informal letter and use "affectionately" to close a letter to a friend, family member or significant other.

 11. D Be prepared to provide an update. It is important for a meeting participant to be prepared to present the required information at a scheduled meeting. Being unprepared is unprofessional and inconsiderate of the other participants' time. Without the necessary information, the meeting may need to be rescheduled. Meeting participants should not monopolize the conversation. New company policies would be relevant only if they affect the project. Otherwise, they should be communicated outside the project-status meeting. It is not always necessary to take notes for the group.  SOURCE: CO:063 SOURCE: Bovee, C.L., & Thill, J.V. (2008). Business communication today (9th ed.) [pp. 47-48]. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.   
 12. B Empathetic. An important part of building positive customer/client relations involves the way the business's employees treat the customers. When employees are consistently courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful, customers are likely to return to the business. To help customers, employees should try to be empathetic. Empathy is the ability to relate to another person's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Employees who can step into their customers' shoes are able to see things from their customers' viewpoints. Being empathic can help calm angry customers, resolve problems quickly, and identify goods and services that will satisfy the customers' needs. A resourceful person has the ability to get the necessary things to perform a task or complete a project. A knowledgeable person has accurate or necessary information. An accommodating person gives others what they want. The ability to see things from a customer's viewpoint is not an example of being a resourceful, knowledgeable, or accommodating person.   SOURCE: CR:003 SOURCE: CR LAP 1Accentuate the Positive (Nature of Customer Relations)  
 13. B It can generate repeat business. Solving difficult-customer situations benefits your company because it is likely to generate repeat business. When customers are happy and satisfied with the service you provide, they will patronize your business over and over again. It doesn't mean that you will never encounter difficult customers again. No business will ever be exempt from dealing with these situations. You may get a promotion if you effectively handle difficult customers, but there is no guarantee of that. Solving difficult-customer situations doesn't mean that every employee will get a promotion. SOURCE: CR:009 SOURCE: CR LAP 3Making Mad Glad (Handling Difficult Customers)  
 14. C Appropriate location. Lodging properties are built with the factors of accessibility, cumulative attraction, and interception in mind. Open houses are held by the sales and marketing staff to promote the product to targeted guests. Global reservation systems are computerized links between a property's reservation system, a central reservation office, and an airline's reservation system and are often used by travel agents. Familiarization tours are used by lodging operators to promote their properties to travel agents and tour operators. SOURCE: DS:075 SOURCE: Reynolds, J.S. & Chase, D.M. (2014).

 15. C Economic goods. Economic goods are physical objects that are useful, scarce, and transferable which satisfy economic wants. Flowers are economic goods because you are able to feel, smell, and see them. They are useful because they are beautiful, and many people want to plant them in their yards. If they are seasonal flowers, they are also scarce because they are only available at a certain time of the year. Specialty goods are consumer goods with special or unique characteristics. Services are actions that satisfy economic needs or wants. SOURCE: EC:002 SOURCE: EC LAP 10Get the Goods on Goods and Services (Goods and Services)  
 16. B Capital goods. Capital goods are the manufactured or constructed items that are used to produce goods and services. Labor is the work people do. Management is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling activities in order to achieve goals or objectives. Natural resources are any resources found in nature (such as land, water, and timber) that are used to produce goods or services. SOURCE: EC:003 SOURCE: EC LAP 14Be Resourceful (Economic Resources)  
 17. A Financial analysis. This is the process of planning, maintaining, monitoring, controlling, and reporting the use of financial resources. The information in financial records is used to measure and report the financial condition of a business, and would indicate if there were funds available to hire more employees. Strategic management is the process of planning, controlling, and organizing an organization or department. Marketing is the process of creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders. Production is the process or activity of producing goods and services wanted by consumers. SOURCE: EC:071 SOURCE: EC LAP 19Strictly Business (Business Activities)  
 18. A Insurance may be purchased to cover these risks. "Pure" risk means the possibility of loss or no loss, as in the case of fire or a hurricane. A business may gain from a speculative risk, where there may be a loss, no change, or a gain. Buying shares of stock is an example of a speculative risk. "Pure" risks can be insured against; no insurance will cover speculative risks. SOURCE: EC:011 SOURCE: EC LAP 3Lose, Win, or Draw (Business Risk)  
 19. B Resources. Gross domestic product is the final market value of the total output of all goods and services produced within a country's geographic boundaries during a year's time. Quite often, resources are not put to their best use. By improving the use of human, capital, and natural resources, countries should be able to increase their gross domestic product. Improving benefits, taxes, and tariffs will not increase the gross domestic product. SOURCE: EC:017 SOURCE: EC LAP 1Measure Up? (Gross Domestic Product)  
 20. A Increase their investment in capital goods. Capital goods are all the materials used in the production of goods and services. When producers are optimistic about business, they increase the purchase of capital goods in order to increase production. They want to have enough goods on hand to meet the increased consumer demand. They also increase their purchase of new goods and their inventory levels, while decreasing their level of savings.

 21. C Honesty. Responsible behavior is made up of five essential elementshonesty, compassion/respect, fairness, accountability, and courage. Determination, flexibility, and leadership are all great characteristics to cultivate, but they are not elements of responsible behavior. SOURCE: EI:021 SOURCE: EI LAP 21Make the Honor Role (Acting Responsibly)  
 22. C Destructive criticism. The manager's action was an example of destructive criticism, which demeans a person without just cause. Constructive criticism is evaluative information to help someone improve. Positive feedback involves praising the employee, and internal feedback is self-evaluation. SOURCE: EI:003 SOURCE: EI LAP 15Grin and Bear It (Using Feedback for Personal Growth)  
 23. D Reduced. People often fear that change will reduce their opportunities to earn status, recognition, etc. In some situations, people fear that change may cause a loss of status, a cut in pay, or unemployment.  Increased, enhanced, and realized opportunities for recognition would be positive outcomes, which would not be threatening to the individual experiencing change. SOURCE: EI:026 SOURCE: Ivancevich, J.M., Konopaske, R., & Matteson, M.T. (2008). Organizational behavior and management (8th ed.) [p. 486]. New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin.  
 24. C Empathetic. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in another person's place. By showing compassion and sharing a similar experience, you are demonstrating empathetic behavior. To be indifferent means that you don't care or wouldn't respond. To be critical means to find fault with your fellow employee's actions. To be impatient means not taking the time to listen or sympathize. SOURCE: EI:030 SOURCE: EI LAP 12Have a Heart (Showing Empathy for Others)  
 25. B Credibility. Credibility is believability. To be able to persuade others, individuals need to be credible so others believe what they say. Individuals who are credible have a reputation of providing accurate information in a fair manner. They are well-informed and use reliable sources to support their opinions and ideas. As a result, others believe them and often are persuaded to do what they want. Individuals do not necessarily need to be flexible, creative, or responsible to be able to persuade others. SOURCE: EI:012 SOURCE: QS LAP 10Win Them Over (Persuade Others)  
 26. A They are afraid of damaging their relationships. A barrier is anything that blocks the way or makes it more difficult to accomplish something. Insecure people are often afraid to be assertive because they are anxious about their interpersonal relationships. Assertive behavior is positive, not negative. Other barriers to assertiveness include disliking conflict of any kind and believing you have no control over your behavior. SOURCE: EI:008 SOURCE: EI LAP 18Assert Yourself (Assertiveness)  
 27. A Authoritarian. This management style is used by people who enjoy being in command, rely on their own judgment, and tell employees exactly how to do their jobs. Democratic managers encourage employee participation in decision making, seek employee input, and share authority. Laissez-faire is a more open style of management that provides only general guidance and avoids giving specific, detailed directions. SOURCE: EI:037 SOURCE: EI LAP 5Can You Relate?

 28. B Visa. Visa is one of the most commonly used bank credit cards. The others are MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. Diners Club is considered a travel and entertainment card. A Macy's credit card is for a credit account offered by that chain of department stores. Shell Oil's credit card is for credit purchases only at its outlets. However, Shell also offers a Shell MasterCard for use wherever MasterCard is accepted. SOURCE: FI:002 SOURCE: FI LAP 2Give Credit Where Credit is Due (Credit and Its Importance)  
 29. C Setting financial goals. Financial goals are objectives that individuals want to achieve. Deciding to save money to buy a car in two years is a financial goal. Individuals often set financial goals based on a time factor because they have a need that they want to satisfy. In this situation, buying a car in two years is the need that can be satisfied by saving money every month. Deciding to save money is not an investment, although the money that is saved might be invested or placed in a savings account. An individual who decides to save money is not analyzing economic conditions. SOURCE: FI:065 SOURCE: Kapoor, J.R., Dlabay, L.R., Hughes, R.J., & Hoyt, W.B. (2005).

 30. D Estate planner. An estate planner often has two jobs. One of these is to help individuals manage and increase their assets during their lifetimes. The other is to distribute those assets to beneficiaries according to the individual's will. Estate planning is important because it involves investing to increase assets so individuals can live comfortably during their working years as well as through retirement. Also, individuals want to know that their assets will be distributed according to their wishes. Guardians, executors, and probate courts are not types of financial-services providers that help individuals manage their assets and distribute those assets to beneficiaries.

 31. D Adverse. Risk-adverse organizations attempt to avoid risk as much as possible. Organizations that fall into this category are typically ones that deal with dangerous situations quite often, such as hospitals, fire and rescue services, and police departments. Risk-tolerant organizations accept risks when necessary, but they do not seek risk. A risk-seeking organization looks for ways to turn risk into a strategic advantage and/or capital. "Risk-speculative" is a fictitious term, although a speculative risk is a risk that may result in loss, no change, or gain.

 32. A Track credit transactions. Accounting software programs allow businesses to efficiently track various financial data and generate financial reports. Accounting software tracks bank and credit transactions, generates invoices, and maintains tax information. Some accounting software programs have inventory applications. Inventory software applications are used to track various types of stock, including office supplies, raw materials, and resale items. Multimedia software is used to create and play audio and video media. Simulation software applications are used to create virtual situations that are similar to real-life situations, such as aircraft-flight simulations. SOURCE: FI:352 SOURCE: Intuit. (2013).

 33. D $17,785. A business's balance sheet shows the business's financial condition at a certain point in time. It includes all assets, liabilities, and the owner's equity. Total liabilities (the debts the business owes) include items such as accounts payable, interest payable, taxes, and long-term notes, such as mortgages. Total liabilities do not include cash or machinery and equipment, which are considered assets. To calculate the business's total liabilities, add the figures for accounts payable, taxes, and interest payable ($12,560 + $2,200 + $3,025 = $17,785). SOURCE: FI:093 SOURCE: Hanson, M. (2010).

 34. A To avoid penalties. There are laws and regulations governing the finance process that businesses should understand in order to operate legally. These laws and regulations involve credit, reporting and paying taxes, issuing stock, etc. By understanding the legal considerations, businesses can avoid violating the law, which also enables them to avoid incurring penalties. Some penalties are significant and can include large fines, restrictions on future operations, or even force the company out of business. Businesses do not need to understand the legal considerations for finance to manage budgets, reduce expenses, or compensate employees. SOURCE: FI:356 SOURCE: Megginson, W.L. & Smart, S.B. (2006).

 35. B Human resources management. This is the process of planning, staffing, leading, and organizing the employees of a business. One way that computer technology impacts this process is by making it possible for businesses to post employment information online so it is available to job seekers in many locations at the same time. As a result, potential job applicants throughout the world have an opportunity to access the Internet and view information about job openings and, in many cases, complete online applications. Business development usually involves attracting more customers to increase sales. Corporate communications usually involves communication within the business. Organizational decision making involves making decisions about the structure of the business. SOURCE: HR:412 SOURCE: Dlabay, L.R., Burrow, J.L., & Kleindl, B.A. (2012).

 36. A Room accommodations that the guest has selected in the past. Although knowing the chef's specials and specialties, special events at the hotel, and the total number of booked rooms might be nice, that information would not be as useful in this situation as the guest's past room accommodations. Hotel staff could more successfully personalize the guest's stay if they knew such details as whether the guest prefers a smoking or non-smoking room, a handicap-accessible room, a king bed, a suite, etc. SOURCE: IM:420 SOURCE: Reynolds, J.S.

 37. A Trade association. Secondary information is information that has already been collected by others. A trade association is a group of persons in the same industry (e.g., hospitality) or geographic area who form a society to solve their common problems. Trade associations often gather marketing information about their industries, so they are a good source for obtaining secondary information about industry trends. A sampling plan is an outline or document that describes the process of choosing a representative group of consumers to survey. Guest comment cards and telephone interviews are sources of primary information, which is new information collected for a specific purpose.

 40. D Trade magazines. These publications provide insight into technological changes occurring specifically in hospitality and tourism marketing. They are also a good source to use when tracking social/cultural changes and legal changes. By staying on top of environmental changes occurring in the industry, hospitality and tourism marketers are better positioned to take advantage of the changes. Customers may or may not be in the hospitality and tourism industry, so their knowledge of technological changes will probably be limited. The average check size is a good source to track when examining economic changes. Consumer magazines are of general interest and would not address the hospitality and tourism industry specifically.

 41. C Observation. When you observe customers in action while they're in the hotel restaurant, you can obtain a more accurate picture of their buying or usage patterns/habits.

 42. D Use meaningful comparisons. When the presenter of a research report compares the findings with information previously known by the audience, the presenter helps to make the findings concrete and meaningful to the audience.

Calling on the audience to explain their understanding of the research and asking them questions are classroom activitiesnot something done in the business world.

 43. B Services. Services are defined as intangible objects that can be sold. Services marketing refers to the actions taken to develop, promote, and distribute the intangible object. The congressional candidate is tangible but is hiring an agency to perform an intangible act, which is to develop an advertising program. Product marketing develops, promotes, and distributes tangible objects that can be sold, such as shoes or trucks. Products can be held or touched; services cannot.

 44. A Professional buyers are still people with values, expectations, etc. Business customers and individual consumers are not the same. But, business-to-business marketers should treat business customers with some of the same considerations they do individual consumers because professional buyers are still people with values, expectations, etc. They will not be able to set aside all of their cultural, social, and psychological influences just because they are making business purchases. It may or may not be culturally acceptable to treat business customers with certain considerations, but a business will not incur fines for not doing so.

 45. B To prompt guests to return. Guest history records contain addresses from which the marketing division can prepare mailing lists. Promotional mailings can be sent to guests encouraging them to return to the hotel or motel. The personal information on the cards is also valuable in developing other promotional activities that will encourage return visits. The accounting division handles overdue accounts or turns them over to a collection agency. The other alternatives are uses of guest history records that are not part of marketing.

 49. B The same criteria. The query is the mechanism used to obtain the desired information from the database. The desired information involves pulling records that have the same or matching criteria. For example, a business that wants to obtain its customers' credit transactions from the state of Wisconsin for July 1, 2009 would set the query using the appropriate values for the credit, state, and date fields to pull all of the records with the desired information. Some of the other information in various database fields may differ or be dissimilar, such as the name and address of each customer.

 51. A Work in various locations. The increased use of computers and telecommunications equipment is changing the way many companies operate and do business. At one time, most employees worked in one location and communicated with others through written memos and phone calls. Today, computers and telecommunications equipment allow many employees to work in various locations and maintain contact with coworkers, managers, and customers. For example, an employee with a laptop computer can work from home, while traveling by air to an appointment, while conducting business in a foreign country, or while relaxing at the beach. Routine tasks often do not involve the use of computers or telecommunications equipment. The increased use of computers and telecommunications equipment does not necessarily allow employees to participate in management or encourage them to compete with coworkers.

Visitor trends are studied so that the property can predict the number of upcoming reservations and bookings it is likely to receive based on such things as people's ages, incomes, marital status, and travel habits. Competitive trends identify the directions that other properties are moving, including their price adjustments, renovation plans, levels of service, and so forth. Trends in technology provide information about how computers, the Internet, and new equipment are likely to change the way in which properties operate. Industry trends give an idea as to the impact that other businesses are likely to have on the property, especially those (e.g., airlines, convention centers, and highway departments) in which the property depends upon for their success.

 53. A Broken handrail on a stairway. Unsafe conditions are those physical or environmental hazards which are present in the workplace, such as icy steps or a slippery floor. Using machinery before reading the instructions, horseplay, and falling asleep on the job are examples of unsafe acts, which are behaviors or actions that may risk the safety of oneself or others.

 54. C S/he can mobilize the necessary resources to get the project done. The project champion is a person who can mobilize the necessary resources to get the project done. S/he is usually a high-ranking person within the organization who sponsors the project but is not necessarily closely involved in the work of the project. S/he is instrumental in choosing a project manager but does not personally fulfill that role. SOURCE: OP:158 SOURCE: OP LAP 6Projected to Win (Nature of Project Management)  
 55. C Determine the project's purpose and scope. The first step in the project-planning process is to determine the project's purpose and scope. These two components are the foundation for the entire project. Determining project costs, identifying needed resources, and identifying project deliverables are all steps that come later in the project-planning process. SOURCE: OP:001 SOURCE: OP LAP 7Chart Your Course (Developing a Project Plan)  
 56. A Minimize inventory investment. The amount of money tied up in excess inventory can be reduced by purchasing just the quantity of supplies that is needed. For example, it makes little financial sense to buy 1,000 boxes of paper clips when only 150 will be needed. An uninterrupted flow of supplies can be provided by ordering them far enough in advance to ensure their delivery when required. Purchasing should always try to buy supplies at the lowest possible price, provided that quality, delivery, and service do not suffer. However, purchasing products at the lowest possible price does not directly relate to purchasing just the quantity of an item that is needed. Finance is responsible for planning a company's cash flow. SOURCE: OP:015 SOURCE: OP LAP 2Buy Right (Purchasing)  
 57. A Reducing waste throughout the entire supply chain. Lean operations are often associated with manufacturing processes but have evolved to include all business functions throughout the supply chain. Businesses that are lean operations optimize their resources and productivity levels and reduce wasted resources, including time, materials, money, etc. Lean operations strive to continuously reduce waste and maximize efficiency. Lean operations may improve the business's image with the public, but that is not the primary purpose. Eliminating certain jobs is an action that a business may take to reduce waste, but this action is not what drives the concept of lean operations. SOURCE: OP:163 SOURCE: Finch, B.J. (2008).

 58. A Arriving at work on time. Employees should arrive on time because the business pays them to work a specific amount of time. Rotating stock helps to keep merchandise fresh and appealing to customers, but daily rotation would increase expenses because of the time it would take. Employees should also help to control expenses by handling products carefully to prevent damage and by being on the lookout for thefts by customers or other employees.

 59. A Monitor and control expenses. An invoice (bill) documents how much a customer or client owes for the goods or services a business provides. To operate, a business orders office supplies, outsources services (e.g., legal advice), leases equipment, etc. Its vendors send the business bills (invoices) that state how much the business owes. The business monitors and tracks the invoices to make sure it is billed correctly. If the business finds a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect tax amount) on a bill, the business will likely contact the vendor to make necessary adjustments. Tracking invoices is one way the business controls its expenses. Accounts receivable are the monies coming into the business. Businesses do not track invoices to evaluate the vendors' performance levels. SOURCE: OP:184 SOURCE: Clark, B., Basteri, C.G., Gassen, C., & Walker, M. (2014). Marketing dynamics (3rd ed.)

 60. D Place surveillance cameras in the lobby. Because surveillance cameras visually capture the activities occurring in the lobby at any time, they often deter individuals from engaging in inappropriate behavior such as robbery, theft, or stalking guests. If individuals do engage in inappropriate behavior, hotels can provide the video to law-enforcement agencies to help them identify the wrongdoers. Evacuation maps help guide guests out of the facility in the event of fire, earthquake, etc. Sprinkler systems put out fires. Requiring guests to sign a registration book will not deter criminal activities. SOURCE: OP:058 SOURCE: Educational Institute of the American Hotel & Lodging Association (2005).

 61. A Travelers with disabilities. Being able to respond to emergency situations is an important consideration in the travel and tourism industry. Many people travel throughout the world, which means that natural disasters and fires are potential dangers. Handling these situations effectively will save lives. Therefore, most emergency procedures include a plan for identifying travelers with disabilities who may need special help in escaping a dangerous situation. Emergency escape and evacuation procedures do not include plans for identifying relatives of passengers. Local authorities are usually responsible for identifying hazardous materials. Identifying suspicious activities is a security consideration.  SOURCE: OP:119 SOURCE: Vallen, G.K., & Vallen, J.J. (2005). Check-in: Check-out (7th ed.) [pp. 534-535].

 62. D Covering visible tattoos. Many people have negative viewpoints when it comes to fashion trends such as visible body piercings and tattoos. However, it is important to remember that the employee is representing the employer while s/he is on the clock and that the employer is paying the salary. An employee might need to compromise by "toning it down" to get and keep a job. A person might need to compromise by removing any piercings or covering visible tattoos while at work. Wearing shoes or a uniform does not necessarily require a person to compromise in terms of personal appearance. Although some women might feel that shaving their legs compromises their personal appearance, it is generally considered an element of hygiene in many countries or cultures. In addition, leg shaving is not generally an issue when wearing slacks. SOURCE: PD:002 SOURCE: PD LAP 5Brand ME! (Personal Appearance)

 64. C Safe working conditions.  Employees have the right to expect that their employers will provide them with a safe place to work. Providing a safe work environment includes providing the proper gear, tools, and equipment to perform tasks in ways that reduce the risk of injury to workers. For example, protective gloves, clothing, eyewear, and hardhats are often necessary to protect employees who work with special equipment or work in hazardous environments. Providing employees with protective gear and equipment does not ensure that they will receive fair wages, benefits, or equal employment opportunities. Professional development opportunities are the ways in which businesspeople can receive additional training, build their skills, and gain education in a specific field. Professional development does not always involve the use of protective gear or equipment. SOURCE: PD:021 SOURCE: Bailey, L.J. (2007). Working (4th ed) [pp. 106, 111].

 65. B Exhibit enthusiasm. To present a confident and professional attitude during a job interview, an applicant should exhibit enthusiasm, which involves showing interest in the job and in the company. To exhibit enthusiasm, the applicant should smile, maintain eye contact with the interviewer, listen attentively, answer questions in as much detail as necessary, and ask appropriate questions. To present a positive impression, the applicant must also dress appropriately for the interview, which often involves wearing formal business attire, such as a business suit.

 67. A Serving on committees outside your job description. By volunteering to serve on committees not directly related to your job description, you have the opportunity to keep your name in the minds of company leaders. That will help them to think of you when opportunities arise. You should thank people for compliments that you receive on your work rather than acting as if the work were no big deal. Etiquette is important for business lunches. You should not discuss business until after people at the table have placed their orders. Bragging to coworkers about your accomplishments can make them resent you. Instead, send regular memos to your bosses to apprise them of the work you've accomplished.

 68. B Prepared food, entertainment, and lodging. The hospitality industry provides services to anyone who travels. The services that the hospitality industry provides include prepared food (e.g., quick-serve restaurants, full-service restaurants which include fine dining), entertainment (e.g., sporting events, concerts), and lodging (e.g., hotel, motel, bed and breakfast inn). Destination planning and transportation (e.g., airlines, bus tours) are functions of the travel and tourism industry. Financial services, such as banks, financial brokerage firms, and mortgage companies, provide consumers monetary assistance. SOURCE: PD:111 SOURCE: Silva, K.E. & Howard, D.M. (2006).

 69. A Penetration pricing. This strategy is used to gain quick recognition from travelers and to acquire an immediate slice of the market share. Psychological pricing refers to a minimally adjusted price that gives the customer a feeling of increased value and/or savings (e.g., $69.95 instead of $70.00). Price lining is the practice of selling goods/services at a limited number of predetermined price points, or levels. A price that is initially set deliberately on the high side is called price skimming. This concept is used to attract the customer who is willing to pay the higher price in order to be one of the first to use the good/service. At some point, the company lowers the price to appeal to other customers. SOURCE: PI:029 SOURCE: Farese, L.S., Kimbrell, G., Woloszyk, C.A. (2012). Marketing essentials (p. 610). Columbus, OH: Glencoe/McGraw-Hill.  
 70. C Generating ideas. The first step in developing new products usually is generating ideas. This might involve thinking of ways to improve or modify existing products, or finding new ways to meet customer needs. Once businesses develop ideas for new products, they often estimate the cost of producing the products which includes purchasing materials and hiring more employees. SOURCE: PM:241 SOURCE: Clark, B., Basteri, C.G., Gassen, C., & Walker, M. (2014). Marketing dynamics (3rd ed.)  [pp. 313-314]. Tinley Park, IL: The Goodheart-Willcox Co.  
 71. C To appeal to the target market. Core values represent the underlying worth of products and the image those products project. Products have value beyond price, and these values often are more important to customers than the price. For example, the core values of one product might include quality construction and a respected reputation. These are the values that appeal to the target market and encourage the target market to buy the products. A business does not communicate the core values of its products to justify the price, develop appropriate advertising, or analyze market research.

 72. B 9. Stock turnover is the number of times stock is sold in a given period of time.

 73. D Vendors. A vendor is a company or its representative that sells products to other businesses. Resort gift shops often ask their vendors questions about which items are popular with customers and are selling well before buying those goods. Vendors are an excellent source of information because they deal with many stores and have a good indication of which items customers want and need. Owners and buyers may be internal sources of information about customers' wants and needs. Shippers transport and deliver goods. SOURCE: PM:260 SOURCE: Cash, R. P., Thomas, C., Wingate, J.

 74. B Shipping arrangements. When businesses buy goods from foreign countries, they should take into consideration the length of time it will take to ship the goods. Making shipping arrangements in foreign countries can be complicated; therefore, it is usually necessary to place orders early. Businesses often need to allow adequate time to apply for special shipping permits and pay various fees to foreign governments before the ordered goods can be shipped. Selling policies, display requirements, and receiving facilities are not factors that businesses consider when determining when to buy goods from foreign countries.

 75. D Cookies and milk. Supporting products are the extra goods and services that accompany the core product, the room at the inn, to add value to that core product.

 76. D Electronic mail. Electronic mail (email) is a cost-effective and quick way to send messages to previous guests. If the ski lodge has collected the guests' email addresses, it can send promotional materials such as downloadable brochures through computer email applications. Telephone calls, postal service, and direct-response television are not the most efficient, cost-effective ways to send promotional messages.

 77. A They lack spam. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) enables businesses to syndicate content from their websites, rather than customizing it. Another advantage to RSS feeds is that they are easy to sign up for and to unsubscribe from. They do not replace the need for web pages since that is what is being syndicated. They optimize, rather than minimize, search engine standings. SOURCE: PR:324 SOURCE: Foster, S. (n.d.). Make the most of RSS feed.

 78. A Measure responses. Email programs are capable of tracking who opened the message and their response to the message. Businesses are able to find out if visitors linked from the email to the business's home page. This tracking capability eliminates the time-consuming and expensive process of calling people on the telephone to determine their response. List management involves organizing information. Text editor is a computer program that is capable of manipulating words. The tracking capability of email marketing programs does not eliminate viruses. SOURCE: PR:165 SOURCE: McCue, T.J.

 79. B Attract the reader's attention and create a mood. Color generally creates more visual stimulation than black and white. For example, an advertisement with a color photograph depicting a tropical vacation spot with white sand and crystal-blue water most likely creates a stronger desire to go to the beach than it would if it was presented in only black and white. The balance in the advertisement refers to the size and position of elements. Color does not necessarily mean that balance will be achieved with the illustration and headline. White space is considered an element of an advertisement and is not distracting. Using color in an advertisement does not necessarily eliminate the need for text or copy. An ad without text does not indicate who sponsored the ad. The sponsor tells you how to get the good or service being advertised. SOURCE: PR:123 SOURCE: Lane, W.R., King, K.W., & Russell, J.T.

 80. B To create a social context for the brand. Illustrations are often used to associate a brand with a certain social setting, group of people, and lifestyle. The resort uses its advertisement illustrations to relay the message that its guests are usually active older adults who are well-off financially. Unusual, clever illustrations are usually used to stimulate reading of the body copy. Dramatic visual effects are typically used to make a brand heroic. Advertisement illustrations normally have a greater purpose than to simply add color to ads.

 81. D Focal point. Effective advertising layouts usually contain a focal point that attracts attention and encourages consumers to read the message. Focal points are often the illustrations, but they also can be a combination of headline and illustration. The goal is to draw the reader into the ad. Although the focal point often is an illustration, it is not necessarily a photograph. Not all ads contain a selling price or a web address.

 84. D Discounts. Often, offering customers incentives for referrals encourages them to provide the name and contact information of their friends and associates. The incentives offered are generally small so that the salesperson doesn't go broke from providing them.

 85. D Gaining the readers' attention. The purpose of direct-marketing copy is to persuade the reader to take action. AIDAattention, interest, desire, actionis an acronym for a technique commonly used to write persuasive messages. The first step is to gain the reader's attention. If the first part of the message does not gain the reader's attention, the reader probably will not finish reading the message. The next step is to generate interest and explain the relevance of the message. The third step is to create a desire to take the necessary action. During this step, the writer often describes the benefit of the action or product. Finally, the writer urges the reader to take action and explains how to do it, such as providing a toll-free number to place an order.  The writer cannot assess the readers' interests or address all of the possible objections the audience might have. SOURCE: PR:294 SOURCE: Clark, B., Basteri, C.G., Gassen, C., & Walker, M. (2014).

 86. C That corrections have been made. A revised proof is the second step in checking advertising proofs.

 87. A A link on the Midwest Lodging Directory website. A directory is an online index of websites that share a common theme, such as lodging in the Midwestern United States. Since the bed and breakfast's target market lives in Indiana and Kentucky, the hotel needs to market itself in publications and on websites such as the Midwest Lodging Directory that reach honeymooners and married couples in both states. While e-zines are another option for marketing online, an article about the hotel in an e-zine for teenagers is unlikely to reach the right audience. An advertisement in the Indiana Adventures e-newsletter would probably reach a portion of the bed and breakfast's target market. However, it is not as likely to attract as much of the target market as the link on the Midwest Lodging Directory would. The U.S. Hotel and Lodging portal might be a popular starting point for searching the Web when someone wants to research lodging throughout the U.S., but its target audience is not likely to be as similar to the Elm Creek Bed and Breakfast's as the Midwest Lodging Directory would be.

 88. D Photos of the inn, breakfast menu, informational brochure, and press releases. Hospitality and tourism businesses develop and distribute press kits to members of the media, such as travel magazines. The purpose of the press kits is to provide tools to obtain publicity through various media outlets. The press kit should contain information about the business. In the example, the bed and breakfast inn might include interior and exterior photos of the inn, the breakfast menu, a print brochure, and press releases. It might also include the owner's business card, copies of published articles, feature-article ideas, a list of awards the inn has received, background information about the owners or the inn, etc. A bed and breakfast in would not include recipe ideas, nor would it include a guest list because this would violate the guests' privacy. The inn might want to include a map of the area and a copy of the community newspaper in the press kit to provide information about for the community surrounding the inn.

 90. C Communicate expectations, tasks, and responsibilities regarding the event to staff. Special events often require extensive planning and can involve a lot of people who are employed by the business as well as external entities. For example, a health and wellness fair might require the coordination of food samples with vendors, recruiting health screeners from local health-care facilities, and obtaining literature regarding health issues. Certain employees might be responsible for sample table set-up or tear-down while others are responsible for soliciting literature, screeners, or items from vendors. Therefore, employees must be informed and updated regarding their responsibilities as they pertain to the event. Although many events are sponsored by external organizations, it is not always the case. It is also possible to hire a consulting company to develop an advertising campaign; however, many businesses do not always have money to do so. Also, not all businesses have the means to increase their promotional budget to accommodate additional staffing needs. SOURCE: PR:068 SOURCE: Pegler, M. M. (2006).

 91. C To maximize effectiveness. Visual merchandising displays are often elaborate and expensive for businesses to construct. Therefore, businesses want the displays to be as effective as possible. One way to maximize the effectiveness of displays is to maintain them in perfect condition. Burned-out lights or exposed price tags are enough to create a distraction that reduces the display's overall effectiveness.

 92. D Databases. A database is computerized storage for information and facts. The use of databases is one way of tracking marketing-communications activities. For example, a business sends out 100,000 promotional letters to customers and receives 25,000 responses. The business maintains a database of the names and characteristics of 100,000 customers as well as information about those who responded. The business can analyze the database to track the effectiveness of the mailing in reaching the target market. Questionnaires, surveys, and interviews are ways of obtaining marketing information rather than ways of tracking marketing-communications activities.

 93. C Attract potential guests. Hotel advertising in tour books is intended to catch the attention of people making travel plans and prompt them to make reservations at the hotel. Buying advertising is not a method of obtaining publicity or a rating from a travel agency. A tour book is not an appropriate channel for recruiting new employees.

 94. B Properly timed. Proper timing is an important characteristic of a sales approach. Restaurant guests should be given time to consider the menu selections before the server opens the sale. Respect, courtesy, enthusiasm, sincerity, and friendliness are additional characteristics of a good sales approach, but do not relate to providing a guest or customer with enough time to review product (menu) information.

 95. B Satisfy the customer's real needs. Only in this way can a business continue or grow. Customers do not necessarily insist on top quality, products with more than one use, or low prices.

 96. A Direct. The sales closing technique in which the travel agent asks the customer if s/he is ready to buy is a direct close. A summative close is a sales technique in which the travel agent reviews the features and benefits at the conclusion of the presentation. An incentive, or bonus, close is a technique that offers the customer something extra for buying now. With the standing-room-only close, the travel agent creates a sense of urgency to purchase by mentioning that there is a limited amount of space on the cruise ship.

 97. A Esteem. Their trip satisfied their need for fulfillment of ego and status because the Ritz Carlton and Tavern on the Green are upscale establishments. Belonging involves the social need to be associated with others. Feeling protected from harm fulfills safety needs. Self-actualization involves realizing maximum potential and emotional well-being.

 98. A Special. A special order is a request for a custom product or a product that the property does not normally have on hand. A blanket order is an order that covers all or part of a retailer's seasonal requirements. A standing order is an order that involves sending specific products at set intervals. An open order is an order for staple goods that is placed with one of several available vendors who can meet the business's immediate requirements (e.g., time, price, quantity). Blanket orders typically are placed several months before the season and do not contain detailed specifications or shipping dates.

 99. D $586.24. To calculate the amount charged to the hotel guest's credit card, first multiply the number of nights stayed by the room rate (4 X $128 = $512). Then, multiply the dollar amount of the four-night stay by the sales tax rate ($512 X 114.5% = $586.24) or ($512 X 14.5% or .145 = $74.24; $512 + $74.24 = $586.24).

 100. D To pay operating expenses. Financial resources are all the sources of money available to the business. All businesses need financial resources to buy supplies and materials, to pay employees, and to cover their other operating expenses. Businesses that do not have adequate financial resources often fail because they cannot pay their expenses. In order to manage their financial resources, businesses develop cash budgets, negotiate bank loans, and open investment accounts. SOURCE: SM:001 SOURCE: SM LAP 3Manage This!
