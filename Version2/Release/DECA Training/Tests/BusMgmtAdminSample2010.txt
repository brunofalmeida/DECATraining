To liquidate. Federal law provides protection for businesses when they are unable to pay their debts by
allowing them to file for bankruptcy. Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves liquidating the business and selling
the assets in order to pay creditors a portion of what the business owes them. The end result of Chapter
7 bankruptcy is that the business is released from debts, but all the assets have been liquidated and the
business no longer exists. Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows a business to reorganize, which may involve
obtaining additional financing. Chapter 7 bankruptcy does not allow a business to consolidate.

A report with supporting facts stating that adopting a new process could increase production-line output
by 35%. An analytical report provides evaluative information. There are different types of analytical
reports. Some analytical reports explain and evaluate problems and issues, while others explain and
evaluate opportunities. And, some analytical reports support previous decisions and actions. A report
indicating that output could increase by 35% presents an opportunity for the business to make more
products. When the business makes more products, it can sell more products, which increases the
business's profitability. Reports that make recommendations about improving a process and stating
reasons for financial losses are addressing problems. A report that provides evidence that a vendor
change was good for the company is an analytical report that supports a previous decision.

Suggestions. Upward communication involves sending a message to someone at a higher level in the
business. Many businesses encourage upward communication by making it possible for employees to
send suggestions and comments to management. Employees who have suggestions on how to improve
quality or make positive changes are given an opportunity to transmit that information upward to
managers. Instructions, evaluations, and corrections are usually transmitted from a higher level down to
employees at a lower level.

Dependable. Employees who are dependable do what they say they will do and keep their commitments
to customers. When employees offer to do something for customers, they must live up to the terms of the
commitment in order to build positive relationships. Customers appreciate dependable employees and
often return to a specific business because of them. Assertive employees stand up for their rights.
Sociable employees are friendly. Creative employees develop unique ideas and solutions to problems.
These are good characteristics for employees to have, but they do not involve keeping commitments.

Remain calm and courteous. It is especially important in dealing with difficult customers to remain calm

Inflation. Inflation is a rapid rise in prices that may occur when productivity goes down and costs of labor
go up. People buy less when prices are high, resulting in a fall in sales and increased unemployment
which may then cause productivity to drop still further. Continued decreases in productivity tend to
increase inflation. Automation is the use of robots or other automatic equipment to do certain tasks.
Expansion is the first stage of the business cycle characterized by increased spending and borrowing,
increased demand for goods and services, increased employment rates, and decreased interest rates on

Shaking hands. The way in which businesspeople greet each other differs and is affected by the culture
and customs of a given country. For example, the Japanese greet each other by bowing. In some
cultures, it is acceptable to kiss a business associate that you know very well on both cheeks. In the
United States, it is customary to greet business associates with a firm handshake that lasts
approximately five seconds, which should be done while maintaining eye contact and a smile. In the
United States, this greeting signifies confidence and professionalism. Waving is a greeting that people
tend to use in informal or social situations.

Although the Americans and British people speak English, the variations of the language can create

appetizer, or perhaps a sandwich and fries?" The example indicates that vocabulary differences and
word usage can create barriers and cause misunderstandings in the same general language. Both the

Latin Americans tend to have a relaxed attitude about time. Foreign businesspeople must keep in mind
that Latin Americans are less concerned about time than many other cultures; therefore, it is common for
businesspeople to wait on Latin Americans to finish up various tasks before a meeting. Latin Americans
may discuss business matters during dinner, but they often view the dinner hour as a time to get to know
business associates personally. Getting to know business associates personally is very important to Latin
Americans. Because Latin Americans tend to be very friendly and social, close contact during
conversation and warm embraces are customary. While gift giving may be appreciated in some Latin
American countries, it is not the most important aspect of doing business.

but offensive in another culture. Therefore, a businessperson should become familiar with a foreign
country's customs, attitudes, and codes of acceptable conduct before important business meetings, so

Wear or carry leather accessories. In many countries, religious beliefs are closely intertwined with the
political and social aspects of their cultures. Hindu is the primary religion of the Indian people and is an
important aspect of India's culture; therefore, it is important for foreign businesspeople to understand
Hindu customs. Because Hindus believe that cows are sacred creatures, it would be inappropriate and
disrespectful for foreign businesspeople to come to a business meeting wearing a leather belt or carrying
a leather handbag or wallet because leather is cowhide. Dressing in lightweight clothing, eating fruits and
vegetables, and drinking distilled (purified) water are not actions that will offend most Hindu
businesspeople.

Suggest that they meet for lunch at 1:15 p.m. at a restaurant located between the airport and her office.
Managing your commitments in a timely manner means that you allow yourself enough time to complete
important tasks. An important aspect of allowing yourself enough time to complete tasks is making sure
that you "pad" your time in case unexpected situations occur that require immediate attention. In Jana's
case, she has several important commitments in one day. It is important for Jana to meet with the Susan
because she could provide the business with needed financial support. The best way for Jana to handle
the situation is to suggest they meet for lunch between the airport and Jana's office at 1:15. This way, if
Jana's meeting with her boss goes a few minutes longer than expected, she still has time to arrive for her
meeting with Susan on time. Susan will have a rental car, so transportation is not an issue for her. It may
not be convenient for Susan to meet with Jana the following week. Because Susan arrives at 11:30 a.m.
and has a 45-minute drive from the airport, she could not meet at Jana's office at noon. A late meeting at
the airport will not allow Jana enough time to get back to the office to lead her videoconference at 4:30.

allow negative feedback to make you defensive. People who are defensive are easily angered or upset

known as a signature loan, is an amount of money borrowed by an individual or a business simply by
signing a promissory note to repay the loan. No collateral is required for this loan. Both secured and

The wise use of credit. Credit is the arrangement by which individuals can purchase now and pay later.
Many individuals have credit cards because the cards allow them to pay for purchases without using
cash. Then, they receive statements on a monthly basis indicating the amount due. If individuals charge
only the amount they can afford to pay in full every month, they are using credit wisely. By paying in full,
they avoid interest charges which may be high and significantly increase the cost of the purchases.
Charging only the amount they can afford to pay in full every month will not necessarily help individuals
save money for the future. Charging only the amount they can afford to pay in full every month is not a
way to avoid identity theft or an example of making a cash transaction.

Because it is an estimate, it must be flexible rather than written in stone. Many factors can affect a

example, changes in economic trends, shifts in population, or the season of the year may affect budget
expectations. These circumstances require a business's budget to be flexible. Budgets are not
competitive; however, competition is a factor that might affect a business's budget. Budgets may be
complex or simple, and formal or informal depending on the size and type of business. However, these
factors do not impact the effectiveness of a budget.

The human resources function is responsible for developing and implementing employee orientation

them with general company information (e.g., policies), and preparing them to do their jobs (e.g.,

Wisdom, expertise. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight, and information
of internal and external resources to help an organization achieve its goals. An important aspect of
knowledge management involves obtaining and using tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is personal
opinions, experiences, expertise, or understanding that is not easily articulated, stored, or quantified.
Tacit knowledge is an employee's personal "know-how" that affects the ways in which s/he does his/her
job. In the course of performing their jobs, employees might discover or use techniques that improve and
create efficiency. This can have a positive effect on the business, if management can capture this type of
knowledge and integrate it into the organization in a way that will help the business achieve its goals.
Employees are not likely to use their personal finances to improve the business's processes. Although all
employees have special characteristics and skills that can help the business, not all of them have
personal agendas or high levels of ambition or drive. A code is a set of symbols or rules.

Camilla is exhibiting ethical behavior by passing along personal knowledge to help Cecily learn how to do
her job. Many times, employees find ways that help them manage their workloadthings that aren't
always written their job descriptions. This personal knowledge is acquired by trial and error, which occurs
by repeating tasks and activities over time. Personal knowledge might include tips that help the employee
work with or around deficit computer processes, or shortcuts that eliminate waste or improve efficiency. If
Camilla did not provide these tips, it would likely take Cecily more time to become proficient at her job,
which can affect the company's efficiency and ability to achieve its goals. Therefore, Camilla is behaving
in an ethical manner by providing Cecily with tips and personal knowledge. Until Cecily gets acclimated
with her job, she will not know if she has a better way to complete tasks than the way that Camilla

E-mail. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight, and information of internal

discovery is by e-mail. She can construct her message and send it to many people at one time. Kendra
would probably not post this information on the company's web site because this information is not
meaningful to customers or web site visitors. A relational database stores linked or related information.

conducting personal interviews with employees, management might be able to obtain knowledge from
employees about their on-the-job experiencesexperiences that can ultimately affect the success of the
business. Listening to employees' experiences might reveal problems and issues that they encounter
while doing their jobs. Holding customer focus groups, developing a competitive analysis, and obtaining

A document can be changed while the user is viewing it on a monitor. In word-processing programs,
users can change any part of the document, at any time, while viewing the computer monitor. Users can
change font size or style, margins, and other formatting elements. The program does not automatically
check documents for spelling unless a proofread option has been activated on an individual computer to
do so. Documents can be reformatted once they have been saved. Although word processors produce
professional-looking documents much faster than typewriters, it does not necessarily reduce the time the
user needs to research a project.

Creates a variety of evaluative reports. Project-management software has many applications and
features that help businesspeople effectively manage both short- and long-term projects. One application
of effective project-management software is the ability to generate reports that summarize a variety of
information, such as expenses, timing, and activity data. Some software can provide cost and variance
analyses. Depending on the type of software being used, it may also allow users the ability to integrate
word processing functions in order to create custom or free-format reports. Because data are entered
manually, project-management software cannot eliminate the coding problems related to human error.
Project-management software does not provide job training, nor does it reduce the need to monitor costs.

Protecting the environment. The growing concern over the condition of the environment is influencing the
way that many companies do business. Businesses that once ignored the damage they did to the
environment are now spending billions of dollars to correct the problems and to change the way they
operate. Public sentiment is forcing these companies to address environmental issues, such as pollution.
The businesses that fail to do their part to protect the environment often anger consumers, which may
lead to a loss of sales. The government, rather than business, is concerned with the distribution of
wealth. Monitoring the economy is not a new trend but an ongoing business function. Businesses do not
regulate government; instead, government regulates business.

Distribution. The function of business that involves the moving, storing, locating, and/or transferring
ownership of goods and services is distribution. Companies should continuously analyze the areas of
distribution (i.e., ordering, receiving, storing, and shipping) to ensure that each area is performing in the
most efficient, cost efficient manner. Companies often analyze transportation services to compare rates
and services. If a company finds that one company provides equal or better transportation services for
less money, it might consider changing transportation vendors. Product management is a marketing
function. Financial resources are sources of money such as sales income, investments, and loans.
Production is the process of producing goods and services.

temporarily be covered with tape. If the hazard is something that requires expert repair, such as
malfunctioning equipment or electrical fixtures, the employee should report the hazard to a supervisor.
Avoiding the hazard or making a note of it is not helpful. Determining the cause of the hazard is not
necessary and not usually the employee's responsibility.

Prioritizing. Prioritizing involves ranking things in the order of their relative importance. When employees
prioritize their work, they evaluate several factors, including due dates and the time it will take to
complete a task. In Luke's situation, he determined that he needed to start acquiring bids before working
on the inventory report, even though the report was due before the bids. Because Luke realized that he
had to allow vendors time to provide the bids, he needed to give them the order specifications promptly.
Delegating is assigning authority or responsibility to others. Luke is not delegating, simplifying, or
communicating information about his workload to others.

Control the project. Controlling is the management function of monitoring the work effort. Various reports
can help project managers monitor the work effort. An activity-status report provides a project manager

the project is running behind, then the project manager can takes steps to get the project back on track.
Reviewing an activity-status report does not create barriers but may identify them. The project manager
determines the project scope and develops project specifications during the project planning phase,
rather than the project execution phase.

Have a cooperative orientation. When a business has a cooperative orientation, it is willing to work with
other businesses to achieve their mutual goals. Having a cooperative orientation involves a willingness to
share relevant information, to negotiate fairly (assertively), and to be trustworthy and reliable. Using
aggressive negotiation tactics will likely not maintain favorable relationships with vendors. In fact, this
action is likely to create conflict. A business does not need to use a decentralized buying structure to
maintain favorable relationships with vendors. Insufficient information is provided to determine whether
the return policies will help or hinder relationships with vendors.

Standing. Standing orders involve sending products at set intervals. This type of purchase order is ideal
for businesses that need the same amount of an item on a regular basis. In the example, SOA
Manufacturing may need the bolts to produce its products. Because SOA knows that it generates a set
amount of outputs in a certain amount of time, it advises its vendor (Colbert Company) to ship a certain
amount of bolts at intervalsevery other week. An advance order is a regular order that is placed now
with delivery requested at a future time (e.g., weeks, months). A seasonal order is an order that is placed
for seasonal merchandise, such as snow shovels or beach umbrellas. An open order is an order for
staple goods that is placed with one of several available vendors who can meet the business's immediate
requirements (e.g., time, price, quantity).

To sell it to end-users. Businesses keep different types of inventory on hand for different reasons. If the
business sells the goods that it buys to end-users, it is resale stock. For example, an appliance-store
chain (retailer) buys stoves, refrigerators, and dishwashers from manufacturers, and sells the items to
consumers. Items such as parts (e.g., nails) and raw materials (e.g., wood) are used to produce
manufactured goods. Businesses also maintain an inventory of supplies (office, cleaning) for employees
to use to complete their work.

consistent behavior among employees, which facilitates a fair work environment. For example, suppose
the business expects its employees to be at work by 8:00 a.m., and one employee consistently comes in
late. If the late employee is not reprimanded for tardiness, it is not fair to the employees who are following
the rules and being responsible. This can create more problems if the responsible employees who arrive
on time must pick up the slack for the late employee. Rules of conduct do not ensure that employees are

such as setting up an electronic data interchange (EDI) with all suppliers, can help the business
streamline the purchasing process, which can reduce the business's expenses over time. Reducing the

The employees' personal ethics may differ from the business's ethics. Ethics are the basic principles that
govern your behavior. Because people differ, their personal ethics often differ. Employees often view
ethics differently when they encounter "gray" situations, or situations in which there is not a clear right or
wrong action or answer. Therefore, it is important for a business to clearly communicate its code of ethics
to its employees, so they understand how they are to behave in business situations. By communicating
the business's code of ethics in the workplace, the business is controlling or reducing its risk of potential
legal problems (e.g. lawsuits) and financial losses, which may occur when employees do not know the
business's ethical expectations and rules. Businesses often document ethical issues and expectations in
their employee handbooks. Ethics are a stable pattern of behavior exhibited over time. Therefore,
businesses do not frequently change their ethics. Governments do not require all businesses to offer
ethics training programs.

Firewalls. Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and
procedures to limit business losses. Businesses use technology to minimize security risks. One way that
businesses control security risks is by installing firewalls on their computer networks. Firewalls are
computer programs designed to prevent computer hackers from obtaining confidential financial data. A
frame allows a computer us er the ability to view more than one web page at a time in a single browser.

Controlling their risks. Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling,
preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves
complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may be sued or fined, which could
result in substantial financial losses. A failure to comply with laws may also affect the business's
credibility with its customers. If customers feel that the business behaves in a legally negligent manner,
they may believe that the business is untrustworthy and may decide not to buy from the business. A
business that effectively controls its risks is more likely to reduce its liabilities than increase them. A
contract is a legal agreement between two or more businesses stating that one party is to do something
in return for something provided by the other party.

What do we want to do? The management function of deciding what will be done and how it will be
accomplished is planning. A primary aspect of the planning function is determining the goals or desired

"What do we want to do?" Deciding who will do the work is a staffing activity. Measuring the success or
achievement of goals is a controlling activity. Determining how to monitor the work effort is a directing

A manager disciplines an employee for inappropriate behavior in the workplace. Directing is the
management function of providing guidance to workers and work projects. An important part of guiding
workers involves disciplining them when necessary. Sometimes, when employees are not doing what
they need to be doing, managers need to discipline them. This might involve telling them that certain
behaviors are inappropriate. Interviewing job applicants is a staffing activity. Coordinating tasks is an
organizing activity. Recommending changes is a controlling activity.

Suitable, understandable, and timely. Control is a management function that monitors the work effort. For
managers to control business activities in an effective manner, control methods must be applicable for
the situation (e.g., a graphic artist performs different activities than the plant manager); understandable
so employees perform activities correctly; and timely (e.g., products are not shipped before they are
packed appropriately). Generally, effective control systems are also economical (cost effective) and
relevant. The rigidity, flexibility, transferability, responsiveness, and tangibility of the control system are
often dependent on the situation.
