$473,600. When developing a budget, a business organizes its budget information by creating
categories. One category is expenses which includes salaries and wages. Businesses need to budget
the amount of money they need to pay their employees for a period of time such as a year. To calculate

by the number of employees ($36,000 x 12 = $432,000). Calculate the wages for part-time employees by
multiplying the hourly wage by the number of hours per week and then by the number of employees, and
finally by the number of weeks in a year ($8 x 20 = $160 x 5 = $800 x 52 = $41,600). Add the two totals

Disciplining a whistle-blower. A whistle-blower is an employee who informs on a company that is doing
something wrong or harmful. In most cases, the employee tells an agency that has the authority to make
the company change its ways. An example is an employee reporting a safety hazard to an agency that
can make the company correct the problem, pay a fine, or both. If businesses take disciplinary action
against a whistle-blower, they are being unethical because the employee has the right to report
wrongdoing. Unethical discipline might include giving the employee bad performance ratings that are not
appropriate or denying promotions that have been earned. Ethical businesses try to treat all employees
equally and not punish those who point out problems. Downsizing the workforce is ethical if handled
correctly and often occurs when the economy is slow. Businesses are not required to offer part-time
positions. Monitoring the use of supplies is a routine business activity.

Fire. If flammable materials come in contact with extreme heat, there is a danger of starting a fire.
Electrical hazards such as a short can be caused by frayed electrical cords with exposed wires,
overloaded electrical outlets, and electrical appliances that could come in contact with water. A shock can
result from human contact with a live electrical circuit. Housekeeping hazards include poorly stacked
boxes of merchandise, things left on the floor, and spilled liquids.

Consideration. In order for a contract to be legally binding, something of value must be exchanged. In this
case, the rent is being exchanged for space. Agreement requires an offer be made by one party and
accepted by the second party. Competent parties requires those entering a contract to be of legal age
and to meet other criteria. Legality refers to the terms of the offer being within the law.

Conduct. Conduct is the way a person acts or behaves. Laws are rules that provide a person with
guidance about appropriate behavior. Without laws, some people might behave in dangerous or
unethical ways. A person who is caught breaking a law can be subject to punishment (e.g., fine,
employment dismissal, prison sentence). Opinions and ideas are a person's thoughts that are generated
in the mind. Because people think differently and ideas are often subjective, laws do not necessarily
provide them with a model for appropriate thinking. Language refers to the way a person presents verbal
or written information.

Believes his/her rights have been violated. A civil lawsuit is a personal complaint in which one party
believes that another party has violated his/her rights by acting in a negligent way. For example, a person
who is injured in an accident might file a lawsuit against the person who caused the accident. A statutory
law is a written regulation that is approved by a governing body. When a person breaks his/her own code
of ethics, s/he doesn't necessarily file a civil lawsuit against someone else. An appeal is an action in
which a defendant requests that another court review a previous court's decision as it relates to his/her
case.

Grand. A grand jury convenes to review the evidence and information about a situation or case. If the
grand jury determines that enough evidence exists to prosecute a person for a crime, then the defendant
is charged with the crime. The trial jury consists of selected citizens that listen to evidence and determine
the defendant's guilt or innocence. Discovery and preliminary are not terms commonly used to describe a
type of jury.

Small claims. Small claims courts usually handle civil cases that involve the settlement of minor
damages, usually no more than $5,000. Federal appellate courts preside over appealed cases involving
federal questions, the diversity of citizenships, or those in which the U.S. is a party (defendant, plaintiff).
The state supreme courts hear cases related to state issues and do not generally make decisions in
cases involving low damage amounts. Probate courts deal primarily with cases involving wills and
estates.

plaintiff that is accusing the defendant (company president) of insider trading, the federal district court
presides over the case. State supreme courts and state appellate courts hear cases involving state
matters, rather than federal ones. Probate courts deal primarily with cases involving wills and estates.

Probation. Probation allows a person to remain in the community but must report his/her activities to a
court-appointed officer. Because of overcrowding in the prison system, probation is an alternative
punishment for people who do not pose a significant threat to the community. A judge might require a
person to perform community service as part of a punishment in conjunction with probation. Volunteer
work occurs when a person performs activities based on his/her free will. If necessary, drug testing might
be a requirement of probation. An employer dismisses or fires its employees, not a court of law.

A well-known actor files a lawsuit against a publishing company with charges of libel. Tort is the
deliberate or unintentional act of wrongful or negligent behavior that is inflicted upon another person. In
tort cases, the plaintiff can sue the negligent party (defendant) for personal damages. When a publishing
company writes untrue statements about someone, the company is engaging in the unlawful act of libel.
A person's (actor) reputation and credibility can be damaged when a company (publisher) makes untrue
statements about him/her. A judge imposing a sentence, a motorist paying a parking ticket, and a public
official paying a fine and serving a jail sentence are examples of legal actions related to criminal
activities, rather than tort.

Care. Under common law, people are required to behave in a socially acceptable and responsible
manner. This is called a person's duty of (due) care. Responsible behavior includes exhibiting behavior
that does not cause harm. For example, a person who drives at a very high speed in a residential
neighborhood is not following the basic duty of care. Empathy, control, and ethics are not widely
recognized terms that describe basic tort duties.

Medical bills. A person who is injured while on a business's property can file a lawsuit against the
business when the business exhibits negligence. In the example, the Pizza Palace does not exhibit
reasonable and responsible behavior because it fails to clear ice from the parking lot, making it
dangerous for customers. Usually, when a plaintiff (injured party) sues a business (Pizza Palace), s/he is
requesting monetary restitution to cover medical bills that are associated with the injury. Sometimes, a
defendant is required to pay for additional damages to the plaintiff, such as lost wages resulting from the
injury. Usually, a business that is involved in a tort lawsuit is not required to pay for the plaintiff's property
liens, inheritance taxes, or traffic fines.

Judges often make decisions for cases that involve oral contracts between two parties. A contract is an
agreement between two or more parties stating that one party is to do something in return for something
provided by another party. Although it is in the best interest of both parties to document a contractual
agreement in writing, it is not always done. Therefore, judges must often make decisions involving oral
contracts. Arbitration occurs when a third party makes a final decision regarding a dispute and each party
agrees to abide by the decision. Legal decisions (e.g., implied contract disputes) are made by the court
system. Contingency contracts usually consist of specific stipulations for certain conditions and tend to be
narrow in scope.

Yes, if the minor's parent cosigns a contractual agreement to purchase the car. To enforce a contract, a
judge must find that each party has the capacity to perform or carry out an agreement. Minors can enter
into contracts, but are subject to limited capacity. This means that minors can void the agreement without
personal penalty. However, if the minor's parent cosigns the contract, the agreement can be enforced
because the consigner is still legally bound to adhere to the contract. Contractual capacity refers to the
level or ability a person has to enter a contract. Contractual capacity does not prevent contract breaches
from occurring. A business or another adult does not have the option to void a contract with a minor.

Mutual consideration. A contract is an agreement between two or more people stating that one party is to
do something in return for something provided by the other party. Contract disputes can occur when one
or both parties are not clear about the other party's expectations. Court judges who make decisions
about contract disputes often consider if the contract is beneficial to both parties, or contains mutual
consideration. Precedent refers to court decisions that are made on the basis of previous, similar court
decisions. Jurisdiction is the level of authority that a particular court has to try cases. Due process refers
to the concept that everyone is entitled to a fair hearing or trial.

Parol evidence rule. Two parties often have verbal discussions about specific points of a written contract
before and after signing it. When the verbal discussions differ from the written contract terms, disputes
often occur. The parol evidence rule provides judges with guidance in resolving this type of issue. The
rule states that verbal agreements that occur before the signing of the written document cannot be used
to contradict the written agreement. It also states that oral modifications that occur after signing a written
contract are factors that the judge can consider, unless the written contract states otherwise.
Commercial disparagement, proximity of disclosure, and express claim provision are not terms widely
used to describe the legal issues relating to oral and written contract disputes.

that s/he is loyal, trustworthy, and acting in the best interest of his/her client (principal) is fostering a
fiduciary relationship. Authoritative relationships are based on a particular level of control. Principal is a
legal term that describes the client. Legislative processes involve the procedures in which people or

Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction refers to the authority that a court system has to decide legal disputes.
E-commerce allows a company to conduct business transactions quickly and efficiently. Because
different states, principalities, regions, and countries have different laws and legal procedures, it is often
difficult to determine who has the authority to resolve disputes that relate to e-commerce. Presence is the
physical location of someone or something. Precedent occurs when a legal decision is based on a legal
decision from a previous case that is similar in nature. A resolution is an outcome or decision.

access search engines, they type key words into the search field to find the information for which they are
looking. Infringement problems occur when the meta tag associates one entity with another person or
business without their permission. An endorsement is a written or verbal approval by a reputable external
source. An autoresponder is a computer program that automatically returns a specified message to

Review the other company's polices about linking terms and conditions of use. A link is a function that
transfers a web user to a specific page or place on the Web. Businesses often use links to connect a web
user to another organization's web site. Legal problems might occur if the business engages in copyright
or trademark infringement or violates a company's deep linking policies. To prevent legal disputes, it is a
good idea for a business to review the other company's linking policies before adding a link to its own
web site. Web-linking permits are not distributed by an international agency. Estate attorneys do not
generally develop contracts for Internet businesses. A product disclaimer does not relieve a business of
copyright infringement liability.

Yes, when proof shows that two or more people share profits, a relationship may exist under the
partnership by implication provision. In some countries (e.g., United States), a legal provision states that
involuntary partnerships can exist in certain situations (e.g., the ongoing sharing of profits) without legal
documents to acknowledge the partnership. The partnership by implication provision is valid when two or
more people are involved, rather than three or more people. Documents such as bank statements and
correspondence can prove that a partnership relationship exists even though the partners may file
separate income tax reports. Although circumstances depend on the physical location of the partnership,
most general partnerships are not required to file the articles of partnership form.

Price fixing. Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which competing businesses agree on prices
of their products, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Pricing fixing also keeps smaller businesses
from being able to compete with those businesses that engage in the illegal activity. Therefore, the
antitrust laws not only protect consumers, they also protect other businesses from being unfairly pushed
out of the market. Monopoly refers to a condition in which one supplier controls a market and there are
no substitute goods or services readily available. Antitrust laws are in place to protect consumers and
businesses from monopolistic activities; however, the term equitable monopoly is not one that is widely
recognized in the business law field. International trade and sponsorship exploitation are not illegal
activities that are usually regulated by antitrust laws.

Intangible. Intangible is something that is not capable of being detected through the senses. Intellectual
property refers to ideas or formulas that a person develops, which cannot be detected through the
senses. Ideas often become concrete items (e.g., books, logos). Copyrights, patents, and trademarks are
legal solutions to protect intellectual property from being stolen or misused. Physical items (e.g., food)
are tangible. Since intellectual property is not concrete, it does not have the physical properties of
inflexibility (rigidity) or elasticity (flexibility).

Image. A trademark prevents others from using a symbol, design, or work that is used by a producer to
identify a good or service. A logo (e.g., Nike swoosh) is used to convey a certain image and create brand
awareness in the marketplace. By registering a symbol or design with the government, a business legally
owns the symbol or design. Trademarks discourage others from using the symbol or design because
unauthorized users can be prosecuted. Copyrights protect a business's information (e.g., formulas,
literature, music). Patents protect inventions. Utility refers to usefulness. A business can apply for a utility
patent for a process that improves or increases a business's usefulness.

Resource allocation. Resources are the things that are used to produce goods and services and to run a
business. Business resources might include money, raw materials, personnel, and vendors. A business
that has legal problems often moves, and uses its resources in other ways. For example, a business
might reallocate some of its profits to pay for lawyers. Or, employees might take time away from their
jobs to testify on the company's behalf. A distribution channel is the route a product takes to reach the
end user. A distribution channel is one of a business's resources and is not always affected by a
company's legal issues. Property value is the amount of money that something (e.g., land, equipment) is
worth. Purchasing procedures are the guidelines a business uses to buy goods and services. Property
values and purchasing procedures are not always primary business components that are affected by a
company's legal problems.

Voir dire. The step in the legal process that involves selecting jurors for a trial is called voir dire. During
voir dire, the plaintiff's and defendant's attorneys ask the potential jurors questions. The questions are
considered to determine if the jurors can follow the court's rules and don't have preconceived ideas (bias)
about the issues or people involved in the trial. Peremptory challenge is an element of voir dire. It occurs
when one attorney excuses a potential juror because s/he does not feel that the juror can be objective
during the trial. Cross-examination occurs when an attorney engages in defense questioning of a
witness. A litmus test refers to questioning used by governing bodies to determine a political candidate's
opinions about a particular issue.

Project the image of the business. The way in which employees handle telephone calls projects the
image of the business and its level of service. Handling calls in a businesslike manner can increase
business. Using professional telephone techniques includes making the caller feel important, and not

qualify for promotion, but these are not primary objectives.

Identify the customer's needs. Before a presentation can be developed, the speaker must understand the
needs of the audience. Persuasion is an action in which change is a desired outcome. The message
should indicate how the change will meet unfulfilled needs. Once the customer's needs are identified, the
presenter can use persuasive techniques such as appealing to emotions and creating a desire for the
product to support the message. It is at this time that the message sender considers reactions or barriers
to the message.

To provide an answer to a problem. Proposals are intended to answer questions or provide
recommendations to solve problems. Businesses often ask employees to research a particular situation

Ethical. Satisfied customers often tell employees that they are pleased with a good or service. When this
happens, it is ethical to ask the customer to pass on that information to management. Favorable
comments from customers carry more weight than information provided by employees. In most cases,
satisfied customers are willing to write a short letter or make a phone call expressing their satisfaction.
Employees who ask customers to do so are behaving ethically because they are simply asking
customers to be truthful. Politely asking customers to pass on favorable information is not an example of
aggressive, questionable, or unfair behavior. This practice is common in business and intended to let
management know that employees are performing effectively.

The supplier employs full-line forcing without allowing competing products. The practice of full-line forcing
by a supplier is designed to ensure that intermediaries acquire new products and make available to
customers a suitable range of products. Suppliers requiring channel members to purchase their entire
line to obtain any of their products is a type of tying agreement and is legal as long as competitive brands
are also allowed to be carried. Tying agreements are legal when the supplier alone can provide the
products and when a company has just entered the market.

Ethical business practices. Studies have shown a strong relationship between customer satisfaction and
a company's ethical behavior. Building customer loyalty gives a business a competitive advantage and is
profitable. Taking care of employees tends to encourage employees to take care of business. Paying
higher wages is not the only requirement for employee commitment. Pricing strategies can ensure profit
but have little impact on employee commitment and customer loyalty. Customer satisfaction, employee
contentment, and profit are not directly linked to automated distribution centers.

Development of new products. Competition encourages businesses to develop new products in order to
meet consumers' needs. Businesses feel that the company which best satisfies consumers will be the
most successful company. Competition helps to control prices because businesses must keep prices in
line with production costs in order to be competitive. Businesses must also maintain or improve product
quality to be competitive. A monopoly exists when a market is controlled by one supplier, and there are
no substitute goods or services readily available. No competition exists in a true monopoly.

Negative. The law of diminishing returns states that if all the factors of production remain the same
except one, additions to the one variable factor will eventually decrease the level of productivity. If a
business adds too many workers, the level of productivity will decrease and may even become negative if
those workers do not have sufficient resources to function properly. A business with too many workers
may end up spending more money to produce products than the products generate in income. At that
point, the marginal product turns negative. The addition of too many workers does not cause the marginal
product to turn upward or positive. Workers are a variable factor in production over which a business has
control.

Purchasing power decreases. When the inflation rate is higher than the percent of raise that employees
receive, the purchasing power of those employees decreases. This has a negative effect on the economy
because the higher inflation rate means higher prices for goods and services. Although the employees
received a raise, the raise was not equal to the rate of inflation, so employees actually lost purchasing
power. They have more money to spend, but the goods and services they want cost more than their pay
increase. The employees' take-home pay increases although it will not buy the same level of goods and
services because of the higher inflation rate. When inflation is high, interest rates usually increase. A
small rise in inflation will not necessarily affect employment levels.

Acquire foreign language skills. The workplace is becoming more global and multinational. In order to be

they can do this is to acquire foreign language skills. By learning something about the language of their
customers or coworkers, they will develop an understanding of the foreign culture and become more
sensitive to, and understanding of, the differences. Businesspeople do not develop cultural sensitivity by
revising research techniques, maintaining current leadership styles, or preserving communication
methods. In fact, businesspeople may need to revise their style of leadership and change the way they
communicate in order to develop cultural sensitivity.

Information. Businesses often need a great deal of information in order to make good decisions. Instead

to pay. Businesses keep records of the salaries and deductions to verify the amount the employees
contributed and to explain the deductions if necessary. Information about employees' salaries and
deductions are not maintained in a business's accounting system, operating budget, or expense reports.

$195. Employees should obtain permission before using company equipment, such as the copy machine,
for personal use in order to help control expenses. Over a period of time, personal use of the company
copy machine costs the business money because it must buy the paper and toner and pay for necessary
repairs. In this example, five employees make 25 copies a week for a total of 125 copies (25 x 5 = 125). If
each copy costs 3 cents, calculate the weekly expense by multiplying the number of copies by the cost
(125 x 3 cents or .03 = $3.75). Determine the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of

$306,377. One of the main functions of an operating budget is to plan for income. Businesses want to
know that they are generating a sufficient income to make operating worthwhile. Budgeting for
anticipated increases in sales and expenses helps a business to budget income for the coming year. In
this situation, sales are expected to increase by 7% and expenses are expected to increase by 4%. To
calculate the increase in sales, multiply last year's sales by 7% ($690,500 x 7% or .07 = $48,335), and
add that figure to the amount of sales ($690,500 + $48,335 = $738,835). To calculate the increase in
expenses, multiply last year's expenses by 4% ($415,825 x 4% or .04 = $16,633), and add that figure to
the amount of expenses ($415,825 + $16,633 = $432,458). Subtract anticipated expenses from
anticipated sales to determine the amount the business should budget for income ($738,835 - $432,458
= $306,377).

Inferior. Customers often equate high prices with high quality. If a business takes advantage of that belief
and sets a high price on inferior products to suggest that the products are better than those of
competitors, the businesses may be behaving unethically. In such a case, the business is misleading
customers to believe that they are paying more to obtain a high-quality product when the product is
actually inferior to products offered by competitors. Businesses often set high prices on products that are
scarce or unique, but this practice is not unethical. Intangible products are those that are not capable of

Persuade customers to buy more expensive items. Certain pricing practices are usually considered
unethical if they are basically dishonest or immoral. One pricing practice that is considered unethical is
promoting low-priced items that are unavailable for customers to purchase. Businesses that use such
pricing tactics do so only to attract customers and then try to sell them more expensive items. When
customers visit the business to buy the low-priced items, they are told that those items are sold out. This
is unethical because the business never had the low-priced items and advertised them only to attract
customers with the intention of selling them higher priced items. It is not unethical to offer customers
better quality products as long as the low-priced items are available. Businesses do not promote lowpriced
items that are unavailable to match the prices advertised by competitors. Although this practice is
intended to increase sales, it may have the opposite effect if customers feel they are being tricked
because the products they want are not available.

Products are sold below cost. Loss-leader pricing involves selling products near or below cost. In some
situations, laws prohibit the use of loss-leader pricing if the products are sold below cost. The reason is
that the prices may be so low that competition is eliminated. However, the laws governing loss-leader
pricing are seldom enforced because customers benefit from the low prices. Businesses often do not
make any profit on loss-leader pricing because the purpose of that tactic is to attract customers who then
will buy additional items at the regular price. Customers do not pay a premium when buying loss-leader
items. Competitors often match the loss-leader price or try to beat it.

Recycling. Some products are intended to become obsolete or outdated by their very nature or because

producing goods that have a short life span because of their effects on natural resources and the
environment. To handle this dilemma, some businesses are recycling all or parts of these products and
reusing them or turning them into new products. This enables businesses to be ethical while producing
products that are planned to become obsolete. Businesses do not handle the ethical issue of planned
obsolescence by modifying, designing, or screening products.

of winning might be included as a matter of enticement, the ethical question deals with the purchase.

98. C
Protect consumers from deceptive advertising. The regulation of promotional activities is generally
designed to address advertising content and competition issues. Content regulation helps to keep
advertisers from misrepresenting their products to the public. Although it's possible to establish regulation
to increase tax revenues, it is not generally the primary purpose for regulating advertising content.
Promotional activities are also regulated to address competition among businesses rather than consumer
advocate groups. Consumer advocate groups are organizations that influence government and societal
issues on behalf of the consumer. Cooperative advertising refers to the sharing of advertising expenses
between two companies.

Tom tells Mrs. Smith she can save $100 by purchasing a vacuum cleaner without the carpet attachment,
because she has hardwood floors. Tom is doing the customer a favor and demonstrating ethical behavior
by not selling her something for which she has no use. Mrs. Thompson is encouraging John to pad his
expense account, thus costing the company additional money. This practice demonstrates unethical
behavior towards the company. Even though Ron is saving the customer money, he is undercutting his
company. Mayhew's is engaging in a practice that is both illegal and unethical.

Eliminate competition. Unfair and deceptive sales practices, such as price discrimination and exclusive
dealership, are illegal if they tend to eliminate competition. The United States and other countries
regulate sales practices that are specifically intended to drive out competitors or make it difficult for
competitors to operate. Sales practices that tend to reduce incentives, affect performance, or decrease
profitability are not regulated.
