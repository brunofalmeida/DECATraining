Capitalism. The foundation for the United States' economy is capitalism, which depends on honest competition between businesses. Because the ability to compete fairly in the marketplace is important to a capitalistic society, the government's business laws are designed to provide a fair, competitive business environment. Antitrust legislation is an example of a type of law that is designed to protect competition in the marketplace. A command economic system is one in which all or many of the means of production and distribution are owned and controlled by the government. Socialism is a type of command economic system that allows private ownership of businesses. A traditional economic system is one in which people produce only what they must have in order to exist.

The exchange of goods and services. To create a fair trading environment, the government enacts business laws, which are rules that govern the activities involving the production, consumption, and distribution (exchange) of goods and services. Other types of laws regulate activities that relate to national and international events, to the allocation of personal properties, and to personal and societal liberties.

Encourage fair trade among nations. International laws are rules that governments establish to standardize and regulate certain actions at the global level. Each nation has its own laws, which differs by nation. The basis for international laws comes from considering the rules of a variety of sources, which include the nations' customs, various treaties, and different international organizations. By considering the rules enacted by these sources, international laws help provide consistency and fairness when nations engage in international trade. International laws do not eliminate the need to establish embassies. International laws might help preserve or efficiently utilize natural resources, but the laws cannot provide the nation with more nature resources, which are limited. International laws encourage trade, which may or may not reduce a nation's debt.

Choice-of-law clause. Because laws vary by country, enforcing international laws can be tricky. The choice-of-law clause provides a standard of behavior for firms that do business at an international level. The choice-of-law clause is an international edict originating from common law. It provides businesses with the choice to determine which country's laws will govern a contract between two or more businesses that are located in different countries. If a choice is not indicated in the contract, the seller's country governs the law. The articles of incorporation are a document that is necessary in the U.S. for establishing a business as a corporation. Judicial immunity and agreement-at-will doctrine are fictitious terms.

Obtain a desired remedy. Civil courts hear cases and make decisions about torts. Torts are private wrongdoings against a person or a business. The legal objective of the plaintiff who files a tort lawsuit with a civil court is to seek justice by obtaining a remedy, which is relief for the wrongdoing. Examples of remedies include financial compensation, return of personal property from the defendant, or an injunction. An injunction is a court order for the defendant to stop engaging in a certain activity. The legal objective of the plaintiff is not to compensate the other party for the wrongdoing. The legal objective of the criminal court is to seek justice by punishing the defendant, which may also discourage the defendant or others from further wrongdoing.

Appellate. Appellate courts review previous court decisions to determine if the lower-level court made any procedural errors during the course of the trial. Appellate courts look at transcripts of the lower court's proceedings and review any questions that deal with law rather than questions of fact or evidence. Appellate courts review both criminal and civil cases. If an appellate court determines that procedural errors were made, it can overturn the lower court's decision. An inferior court is a lower-level court, such as a small claims court.

Persons. Jurisdiction is the court's authority to hear cases and make legal decisions. Federal courts, for example, are limited to hear cases and make decisions about constitutional issues, which is jurisdiction over subject matter. Other courts, such as those at the state level, have the authority to hear cases and make legal decisions within certain geographic areas. The legal term to describe court authority by geographic location is jurisdiction over persons. State courts may also have jurisdiction over certain subject matter, depending on the structure of the state's court system. Jurisdiction over property refers to the court's authority to make legal decisions about property (e.g., boats, cars, homes) within its boundaries. Jurisdiction over limitations is a fictitious term.

Restitution. A remedy is a way to achieve justice in legal disputes through the court system. Restitution is a remedy in which the judge orders that each party return to the other party the items or the monetary value of the items that the two parties previously exchanged. The judge may use restitution as a remedy when a contract does not meet the necessary criteria to make it legally enforceable. Restitution puts the parties in the same position as they were before the contract existed. Reformation is a remedy in which the court rewrites the contract in a way that reflects the parties' true objectives. Commercial discharge and unified provision are fictitious terms.

Society's actions. Ethics are the basic principles that guide your own behavior, telling you right from wrong. Laws are rules that govern a group's or a society's behavior.

Although some laws affect a nation's politics, its economic system, and business activities, all of these elements are part of society.

Tort. A tort is a private wrongdoing against a person or business. Torts may be intentional (e.g., defamation) or unintentional (e.g., injuries resulting from a car accident). Crimes are wrongdoings against society, such as tax evasion and murder. A petition is a formal request. Duties are obligations or responsibilities.

A board of directors makes business decisions that affect the firm's stockholders. A duty is a legal standard of behavior. The duty of loyalty involves both a fiduciary and a beneficiary. A fiduciary is a person or group who acts on behalf of another person or group—the beneficiary. When the fiduciary takes action, such as making a decision, the fiduciary has the duty to act in the beneficiary's best interest. By doing so, the fiduciary is exhibiting the duty of loyalty to the beneficiary. In the example, the board of directors of a firm (corporation) is the fiduciary that is making decisions which affects the people who own the firm—the stockholders. A repeat customer's making purchasing decisions, a court's determining the legality of a contract, and a plaintiff's taking steps to minimize a claim do not involve the duty of loyalty.

Fiduciary. A duty is a legal standard of behavior. A fiduciary is a person who acts on behalf of another person. Fiduciary duties are standards of behavior in which the fiduciary acts in the best interests of the other person. Examples of fiduciary relationships include a parent and child as well as a corporation's board of directors and its stockholders. The beneficiary is the individual or group that places its trust in the fiduciary to act on its behalf. Unilateral and authoritarian are not types of duties.

Protect the well-being of individuals and businesses. Businesses must follow a variety of government regulations, such as labor laws, environmental laws, and trade regulations. The purpose of regulating business activities is to protect consumers and businesses from unethical behavior and to provide a fair environment in which businesses can compete. In a free-enterprise economic system, regulations encourage competition rather than limit it. Although governments often implement policies that encourage business expansion and change international trade initiatives, these are not primary reasons for regulating business activities.

The warehouse acts negligently. When one business has a contract entrusting its property to another business, it is a bailment agreement. The holder of the property may be held liable for the losses if something happens to the property, such as theft or damage. For example, if a warehouse employee carelessly leaves a match burning, which in turn starts a fire that damages the Brite Company's property, the warehouse has acted negligently and could be held liable for the Brite Company's damaged property. A third-party lawsuit, the entrusting company's financial problems, and the products' sizes are not considerations when determining the liability for property loss.

An injury occurs on a business's property. A business is likely to be held liable for an individual's injuries on the business's property if the business behaves in a negligent manner. Storing stock improperly on shelves is an example of a negligent action. If an item falls from a shelf, hits a customer on the head, which in turn causes the customer to suffer a head injury, then the business is likely to be held liable for the customer's medical bills. Lawsuits are unlikely to occur if a business drops a product line, if an employee fails to meet his/her sales goals, or if a dissatisfied customer returns an incorrect product.

Joint liability. A general partnership is a form of business ownership in which all partners are liable for the business's losses.

Limited liability is a condition in which business owners risk only the amount of their investment. Dual accountability and standard accountability are fictitious terms.

A company prices its products low in an attempt to drive its competitors out of business. Ethics are the principles that guide personal behavior. When a business prices its products very low with the goal to drive its competitors out of business, it may be acting unethically, and possibly illegally. This is because the business is deliberately pricing products so low that smaller businesses cannot afford to compete, which eventually drives them out of business. Increasing prices when production costs increase, setting profit-margin objectives, and using a prestige pricing strategy are legal and ethical business practices.

Capacity. When a judge assesses the legality of a contract, s/he considers several factors. One factor is capacity, which is the ability a person has to enter a contract. Capacity has to do with a person's ability to reason and use sound judgment to enter a contract. A person who has severe mental disabilities, a person who has impaired mental abilities due to drug or alcohol consumption, or a child who is still mentally developing may not have the ability to enter a contract, making it legally unenforceable. However, each situation is unique, and the circumstances surrounding the contract are important factors that the judge also assesses. Consideration refers to the principle that the contract terms were bargained-for or negotiated so that the contract is mutually beneficial for both parties. Authority and implication are not factors that a judge assesses when determining if a contract is legal.

	21.	D
Legality of purpose, consideration, and capacity. A judge determines the legality of a contract by reviewing certain criteria. First, there must be a "meeting of the minds" between the two parties. That is, they must agree that one party will do something in exchange for something else that the other party offers. It must also have consideration, which refers to a bargained-for arrangement that benefits both parties. To enter the contract, both parties must have the capacity, or the mental ability, to do so. Also, legal contracts must have genuineness of assent, which means that both parties must know or understand that they are agreeing to the same thing. Finally, the purpose of the contract cannot break any laws, so the judge assesses the legality of purpose. Concurrent conditions occur in a contract when each party's ability to follow through on a contract promise depends on the other party's performance. Concurrent conditions do not exist in all contracts and are not factors that judges use to determine the legality of a contract.

File a lawsuit. A lawsuit is an action that one person or business brings before the court to obtain justice for another's wrongdoing. When one person does not follow through with the promises that s/he makes in a written contract, the person who was to have received those promises has the right to file a lawsuit against him/her. Law enforcement agents (i.e., the police) arrest wrongdoers. Class action refers to a type of lawsuit in which many people file a claim against another person or business. To file a lawsuit, a person should hire a lawyer to represent her/him, rather than contacting a judge.

Certain groups of workers. Affirmative action is an effort to give special employment consideration to disadvantaged groups. Many of the workers in these groups have experienced discrimination in the past. Affirmative action programs serve to make up for previous unfair employment practices and serve to prevent current and ongoing mistreatment. Workers in these groups include workers who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, etc. It is not the purpose of affirmative action programs to correct unfair employment practices relating to organized labor unions, highly skilled employees, or professional organizations; however, some of the members of these groups might be workers who qualify for affirmative action considerations.

The laws for testing vary by state. Alcohol and drug-testing laws vary by state. Government employees may be tested if they show signs of impairment while on the job, or when the job entails tasks that endanger the public. Most states have specific laws that allow private businesses to test their employees for drugs and alcohol. Testing is usually legal during the employees' working hours rather than when the employees are off duty. Drug and alcohol testing is not a federal felony. Because the laws vary by state, not all employees are subject to drug and alcohol testing.

A person's citizenship and matters regarding infringement are not usually difficult to determine.

Limited liability partnership. A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a form of business ownership that business professionals (e.g., doctors, lawyers, accountants) often use. The purpose of this form of business ownership is to protect innocent partners from the malpractice of the other partners. For example, if a client files a lawsuit against one of the partners and wins the case, the other partners are not liable for the tortuous partner's losses. In a general partnership, all partners are liable for the business's losses. Joint ventures and strategic alliances are not business ownership structures that limit a partner's business liability.

Tying agreements. Antitrust laws are regulations that prevent a person or company from taking any actions to restrain free trade and competition in the marketplace. Business practices that limit competition are price discrimination and tying agreements. Price discrimination is an illegal activity in which a business charges different customers different prices for similar amounts and types of products. Tying agreements are illegal agreements that require a customer to buy other products in order to obtain the desired goods and services. Vertical distribution, competitive bidding, and collective bargaining are not business activities that attempt to limit competition.

Requiring the infringer to pay any profits it earned to the owner. A copyright infringer is a person or business that uses or publishes an artistic work (e.g., music, painting, book) or a portion of that artistic work without the permission of the copyright owner. If the copyright owner files a lawsuit against the infringer, the judge may order the infringer to pay the copyright owner the profits it earned from the materials it sold. The judge may also require the infringer to destroy existing infringement materials, or s/he may call for an injunction, which stops the infringer from distributing materials in the future. A patent, not a copyright, protects inventions. It's a good idea to register artistic works with the copyright office, but it is not always necessary.

Martin downloads a Christina Aguilera song from the Internet without paying for it. A copyright is legal protection that the government grants to the owners of artistic works, such as novels, screenplays, paintings, and music. The purpose of legal protection is to prevent people from using or accessing the material without permission, which includes payment for use. Downloading a song from the Internet without paying for it is an example of copyright infringement. Trademarks protect logos from unauthorized use. Medications are protected through patents. Writing a newspaper article with a quotation is not infringement if the writer acknowledges the original quotation source.

Trademark infringement. A trademark is a symbol (e.g., logo), design, or word that a producer uses to identify a good or service that is registered with the government to prevent use by others. The unauthorized use of a trademark by others is called infringement. By registering the trademark with the government, the trademark owner has the legal right to sue anyone who uses it without permission. Registering a logo with the government does not protect it from identity theft, copyright piracy, or cybersquatting.

Opening statement. During the opening statement, the plaintiff's lawyer explains to the jury what s/he plans to prove during the course of the trial—the defendant's guilt. Then, the defendant's lawyer will explain to the jury how s/he will prove that the defendant is not guilty of the charges. During the closing arguments, the lawyers for each party explain to the jury why the other party is wrong and why a judgment should be made in favor of their respective clients. This occurs after all testimony has been heard and all arguments have been made. After the closing arguments, the judge gives the jury instructions about the deliberation process. The pretrial conference occurs before the trial stage begins.

Injunction. A tort is a private wrongdoing against a person or business. A remedy is relief given to an injured party. Remedy for a tort might include some sort of financial compensation, or it might include an injunction. An injunction is a court order that requires a defendant to stop engaging in a certain activity. For example, upon the request of a plaintiff, a court might order a defendant to stop using a company's logo, which is copyright infringement. Imprisonment, fines, and probation are punishments for crimes.

Ethics. Ethics are the principles that guide an individual's actions. Ethics help a person determine which behaviors are right and which ones are wrong. Each person may hold a different set of ethics, but some principles about right and wrong are generally accepted by society as a whole. These are the principles that serve as a foundation for laws. Laws are rules that govern a group's or a society's behavior. Governments establish laws to standardize and regulate certain actions. For example, most people value life and believe murder is wrong. Societal laws are not based upon a general set of skills, observations, or interactions.

The appropriate government agency. Business owners must follow many types of laws and regulations. If they fail to do so, they may have to pay a fine to the government, which can financially harm the businesses. Business owners who are unsure about certain laws should contact the appropriate government agency. In the example, Anna should contact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to obtain information about filing her federal taxes. If she had a question about state taxes, she should contact her state's taxation agency. A local real-estate attorney, a tax preparer's web blog, and the area's small-claims court would not be the best sources of tax information.

Child labor laws. Child labor laws regulate the environment and conditions under which children can work. The laws regulate the ages at which children can work, the type of jobs they can perform, and the number of hours they can work during a set period. It is important that business owners learn about and follow these laws if they plan to employ teenagers. If a business owner breaks a child labor law, the business could face a fine and/or some other penalty. Although it is important for business owners to know about tax withholding, workers' compensation and, if applicable, corporate reporting responsibilities, these issues do not directly relate to employing teenage workers.

Consult with a lawyer. The U.S. legal system guarantees that every suspect or defendant has the right to consult with a lawyer before, during, and after the litigation process. The Miranda rights, which are read to suspects upon their arrest, advise them that they "have a right to an attorney" and if they don't have one, the court will appoint one to represent them. The legal process does not guarantee that every defendant has a right to resist the booking process, deny arraignment, or set bail.

Preliminary hearing. After a suspect is arrested, is booked, and makes an initial appearance in front of a court magistrate, the prosecutor presents the evidence of the crime to the judge. Based on the evidence presented, the judge determines if there is probable cause (a reason) to hold the defendant for trial. During the arraignment stage, which occurs after the preliminary hearing, the suspect appears in the trial court and enters a plea of guilty, not guilty, or no contest.

Substantive. Laws are generally classified as substantive or procedural. Substantive laws are written rules that protect peoples' rights (e.g., privacy rights) and state their societal duties (e.g., duty of care). Procedural laws are written rules that govern the way that substantive laws are carried out or enforced. A rule that specifies the way in which a plaintiff files a lawsuit is an example of a procedural law. Government agencies enact administrative laws. Comparative law studies and compares the laws of different countries.

Procedural. There are two general classifications of law—substantive and procedural. Substantive laws are written rules that protect peoples' rights and state their societal duties. Procedural laws are written rules that govern the way the substantive laws are enacted or carried out. The requirement that suspects have their Miranda rights read to them upon arrest is an example of a procedural law. Criminal law is a type or body of law that states the actions that are crimes or offenses against society. Ceremonial laws are rules that guide specific activities of certain religions and are not necessarily enacted by a nation or government.

Acted without having a rational business purpose. Managers owe their employers the duties of care and of loyalty. To carry out these duties, managers must act in the best interests of their employers. When managers act in the best interests of their employers, they make decisions that have a rational business purpose—they make logical, sound decisions before they take action. If managers act without having a rational business purpose, they may be liable for the harm done by their actions. A negative attitude and aggressive decision-making are not always factors that a court considers when determining a manager's tort liability.

Illegal behavior. When a manager knows that s/he is breaking the law, the manager is liable for his/her behavior.

Unusual activities, secretive negotiations, and impulsive decision making may or may not involve illegal activities.

Using alternative dispute resolution strategies. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is a way in which businesses settle legal disputes without going through the court triaI process. ADR strategies that businesses might use to resolve a legal dispute include mediation, arbitration, peer-review committees, mini-trials, and "rent-a-judge" options. More businesses are using ADR because it is usually less expensive than going through a court trial. Providing conflict-management training, hiring an independent investigation firm, and consulting with local labor unions may be actions that businesses take to help resolve legal issues when using alternative dispute resolution strategies.

Cyber crimes. Cyber crimes are crimes that use or target computer systems in harmful ways, and they most often use Internet capabilities to carry out the wrongdoings. Examples of cyber crimes include financial theft, identity theft, stalking, hacking, and cyber terrorism. Crimes occurring via the Internet are often difficult to trace because of a lack of evidence. In addition, Internet access is available worldwide, which makes legal jurisdiction difficult to determine. For these reasons, traditional laws are often difficult to apply and enforce. Therefore, many countries are enacting specific laws that address cyber crimes. Wrongdoings that involve computers are not being addressed by enacting laws relating to innovative properties, virtual structures, or capital torts.

Enforceable. For a contract to be enforceable, it must meet certain criteria, which include consideration, agreement, capacity, legality of purpose, and genuineness of assent. After the judge has determined whether the contract meets all of the criteria, s/he can make a decision about the contract and settle the dispute. Certain contracts must be put in writing to be valid and enforceable but not all of them do. Contracts do not need to be honorable. When one party promises to perform a service or action in exchange for payment from the other party, it is a unilateral contract.

Responds to the allegations. After a plaintiff files a lawsuit, the defendant responds to the allegations by admitting fault or denying responsibility. In some cases, the defendant will file a counterclaim against the plaintiff. These actions occur during the pleading stage of the litigation process. Jury selection and motions for a mistrial occur during the trial stage of the civil litigation process. Interrogatories (written testimony) are collected during the discovery stage of the litigation process.

Agreement. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties stating that one party is to do something in return for something that the other party provides. A sales contract involves the exchange of goods and/or services for something else, usually money. For a sales contract to exist, there must be a buyer, a seller, and an agreement. The buyer gives the seller money for the product(s) that the seller provides the buyer. The buyer and seller agree on a price and on the terms of the sale. A sales contract does not always need to appear in written format to exist. A sales contract does not need a witness or a process to exist.

Exclusive dealing. Exclusive dealing is illegal when it hinders a competitive environment. In the example, the manufacturer holds a big part of the market, and is attempting to keep its dealers from selling competing products. This keeps other businesses from entering or competing in the marketplace, which is unfair, particularly to small businesses. Tying agreements are illegal agreements that require a customer to buy other products in order to obtain the desired goods and services. Selective distribution is a business strategy in which a producer sells products through several, but not all, wholesalers and/or retailers. Channel control refers to the level of authority that each member has in the distribution channel.

Hinder competition. Antitrust laws are regulations that prevent a person or company from taking any actions to restrain free trade and competition in the marketplace. Businesses should understand the types of business activities that violate antitrust laws, so they do not engage in them. If a business requires tying agreements or attempts to create a monopoly, it may be violating antitrust laws. The government fines a business when it violates antitrust laws. Actions that restrict efficiency or prohibit authority do not violate antitrust laws.

Entering the marketplace. A slotting allowance is a fee that businesses, usually retailers, charge their suppliers (producers) to stock their items. The purpose of implementing a slotting allowance is to cover the costs associated with setting up, stocking, and selling a new product. Some slotting fees are very high, which is why some businesspeople consider it an unethical practice. Many small businesses cannot afford to pay a high slotting allowance, which limits their ability to enter and compete fairly in the marketplace. Slotting allowances do not prevent small producers from identifying new products, finding other distribution channels, or researching new target markets.

Yes. The invited proposal must reference that company's request for proposals and include all information they were seeking. Invitations to submit proposals include questions and guidelines that must be addressed in every proposal. Prospecting proposals do not have these questions to answer. Even though a company is looking to donate funds, it still needs detailed information about the projects seeking funding in order to make a decision. Therefore, invited proposals should not be written in less detail than prospecting proposals. All proposals, whether invited or prospecting, should be written with the receiving company in mind. This includes conducting research to determine that company's interests, former projects funded, and other information that can tailor the proposal to the needs of the funder.

Eliminate the use of jargon in her directions. Using jargon, or words that may be peculiar to a person, leads to a breakdown in communication. Since Jim is new at the company, he most likely isn't familiar with the jargon she used and therefore was unable to understand her directions clearly. Reminding Jim to do well on the task doesn't improve the directions Mary gave. It simply puts additional pressure on a task he doesn't really understand. Writing these instructions will not help Jim since he doesn't understand the jargon. While using some type of calendar for tracking dates is important, it does not improve Mary's directions.

Prices; up; inflation. Over issuance of currency by a nation's central bank will lead to inflation because the buying power of one species of currency will go down, leading businesses to drive up their prices to earn more real profits.

Deflation is not a result of central banks' issuing too much currency.

The information is often untrue. Gossip is rumor or talk that discloses personal information about another person. This information can harm the person's reputation. Gossip is not always based on fact; therefore, the information revealed is often exaggerated or untrue. Because people differ, some will believe gossip, and others will not. Gossip tends to create distrust. This is because gossipers do not usually keep confidential information to themselves. If too much gossip and distrust in the workplace exists, it can create a tense (rather than relaxed) work environment. Business structure is the way a company is legally established, and is not a reason why employees should avoid gossiping at work.

The issue is not very important. The way a person reacts to conflict is called his/her conflict response mode. The yielding response mode means that one party accommodates or gives in to the other party's request. Yielding is most appropriate when the issue isn't very important, such as deciding where to go to lunch. Bullying tactics are characteristic of the forcing conflict response mode. This often involves physical or emotional abuse, is hurtful to relationships, and is inappropriate to use. A person who wants to look at all sides of the issue is using the problem-solving response mode. A person using the withdrawal response mode tries to ignore or avoid the conflict. This response mode often increases the person's level of stress because s/he is always thinking about how to avoid the other person who is involved in the conflict.

Getting to know the organization's key managers. If an employee has the ability to influence other workers' opinions or actions within the company, the employee is fostering political relationships. Building positive political relationships in the workplace begins by showing a sincere interest in the company, employees, and managers, and by recognizing their importance to the organization. An honest, dependable employee who is willing to network and work with others—including difficult coworkers—can facilitate a positive working environment, which helps the employee gain a positive reputation. This, in turn, helps the employee use his/her reputation to influence organizational decision making. A wise "political player" does not express personal opinions whenever possible. To do so may offend important people within the organization.

Net worth. You would calculate how much you own and how much you owe. To determine net worth, you'd add up the value of all the things you own (e.g., cash, car, equipment, buildings, etc.) and the value of the things you owe (e.g., utilities, mortgage, loans, credit card debt, etc.). Subtract what you owe from what you own, and this figure provides your net worth. Now, you have a starting point to determine how far you need to go (i.e., how much additional money you'll need) to achieve the things that you want to accomplish. Market risk, time horizon, and types of investments are examined after net worth is determined.

The formula for determining marginal revenue is Change in Total Revenue/Change in Sales. Therefore, to calculate marginal revenue, businesses would first need to determine total revenue.

Ethical. Human resources management is the process of planning, staffing, leading, and organizing the business's employees. Ethics are the basic principles that govern your behavior. These principles involve making decisions by considering what is right and what is wrong. In human resources management, ethics usually involve doing what is right by treating all employees fairly. Ethical behavior in human resources management also involves being objective—having a point of view or opinion that is not influenced by bias, prejudice, or outside opinion. Empathetic behavior involves acting according to an intellectual identification with the thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and/or actions of another person. Rational behavior is an action that is based on logic or reason. Competent behavior refers to the ability a person has to carry out a particular action.

Governments, rather than businesses, establish laws to protect individuals from discrimination and harassment. A business might ask a new employee to sign a non-compete agreement, which is a promise that the employee will not work for a competitor for a certain length of time after leaving the business.

Accounts-receivable reports and income statements are accounting records that summarize information about various aspects of a business's revenues. Revenue is generated by a variety of sources, including sales and investments. By reviewing these reports, the business can determine which sources are generating income for the business and where problems exist. Accounts-receivable reports and income statements do not provide a business with information about inventory levels, customer-service ratings, or staffing needs.

If the employee sees a fire in the building, s/he should follow the business's procedures, which would likely include actions such as advising others, activating the fire alarm, evacuating (leaving) the building, and notifying the fire department. The employee would call the police department when dangerous situations (e.g., robberies) occur.

Lead time. Lead time is the amount of time it takes a vendor to process and deliver an order. Lead time is affected by many factors including the distance from the shipper to the recipient, the type of transportation the vendor uses, and the type of product. For example, a custom-made product usually requires more lead time because part or all of the product is not produced until the order is placed. If a product takes three months to produce, the buyer should make sure to order the product at least three months before it is needed, and should make sure to add delivery time. Quantity discounts, unit pricing, and billing issues are important factors that the buyer considers when placing an order, but they do not directly relate to the delivery date.

Earn a profit. The purpose of conducting a break-even analysis is to identify the level of sales needed to reach the break-even point at various prices. The break-even point is the level of sales at which revenues equal total costs. By knowing the break-even points at various prices, the business can estimate its profits, which is important for planning budgets and other business activities. The purpose of a break-even analysis is not to meet consumer demand for the product, to ensure product quality, or to reach production objectives.

Analyze the information. Problem solving is finding solutions for problems or obstacles. Although there are several approaches to problem solving, there are distinct steps that help employees find solutions to issues or solve work-related problems. First, the employee must define what the problem is. Then, the employee should state and check any assumptions that s/he might have about the situation. In many situations, the assumptions are inaccurate or false. After considering assumptions, the employee should collect the facts. After collecting the facts, the employee can then analyze the facts and determine which information is meaningful and useful. After analyzing the facts, the employee can come up with ideas to solve the problem, and then select (make a decision) and implement the best solution.

Aptitude. An aptitude is a natural talent for learning a specific skill. Because math comes easy to Serena, she has an aptitude for it. Because she is good in math, Serena might consider a career that involves math, such as financial planning, engineering, or accounting. A habit is a repetitive behavior. A benefit is a specific advantage or reason for doing something. A procedure is the step-by-step process that a person follows when performing a specific task.

On the job. Employers are generally liable for an employee's injuries if an accident happens while the employee is on the job. Depending on the circumstances, the employer's liability could include employees who are traveling on behalf of the business. Workers' compensation is a type of insurance that employers purchase to provide benefits to employees who are injured on the job. The employer would not be liable for an employee's injuries if the employee is operating personal machinery or if the employee is on unpaid leave.

Loss leader. Loss-leader pricing tactics involve pricing certain products below cost to attract customers to the business. Even though the business may lose money on some products, its goal is to make up the loss by attracting more customers who will buy additional items. This is illegal in some states because it can restrain fair competition. If the Bart Company already has a substantial share of the market, and the smaller businesses that are selling the same or similar products do not have the resources to sell products below cost, then the Bart Company has an unfair advantage because the smaller businesses cannot compete. The Bart Company is not using pricing gouging, bait and switch, or resale-advantage pricing tactics.

Misleading consumers. Incomplete or inaccurate information on product labels may be misleading customers because the labels do not provide all of the facts that customers need to make an informed purchasing decision. In addition, incomplete or inaccurate information on product labels pose potential harm to customers. This is because the customers may use the product inappropriately because the label lacks necessary information to use the product safely. Therefore, the government regulates the type of information that businesses place on their product labels. Product tampering and wrapping problems are product-packaging issues rather than labeling issues. The government does not regulate product label information to prevent a business from making financial mistakes.

Planned obsolescence. By developing new styles and models, marketers encourage consumers to think that the product they have is outdated. This, then, encourages customers to buy the new style or model of the product. This has become a big ethical issue because consumers are trashing perfectly usable goods and filling up landfills with poisonous chemicals. Institutional advertisements focus on promoting attitudes and beliefs as opposed to selling products. Industrial sales are those that occur among businesses. Packaging is not involved in the scenario.

Make them easier for consumers to understand. A warranty is a promise made by the seller to the consumer that the seller will repair or replace a product that does not perform as expected. The government has passed laws that focus on product warranties in order to protect the manufacturer, supply channel members, and the end users. Before laws were in place, consumers often found the warranties confusing because they were not specific or clear, which prompted them to file lawsuits against the businesses. By passing laws that regulate the way businesses present warranties to consumers, the potential for warranty-related lawsuits decreases. The primary reason for regulating warranties is not to transfer the liability to the wholesaler, to protect retailers from fraud and extortion, or to improve relationships among retailers.

Establishes an image of being socially responsible. Consumer-protection regulations are laws that safeguard consumers from any kind of injury that they might suffer during the process of purchasing and/or using consumer products. Businesses that follow consumer-protection regulations earn the public's trust because they are behaving in a socially responsible manner. Businesses following consumer-protection regulations usually experience fewer legal problems and are less likely to have lawsuits filed against them than businesses that do not follow the regulations. The amount of money a business spends on promotion and the possibility of a financial audit are not beneficial actions that directly relate to consumer-protection regulations.

Endorsements and testimonials should only be used if they have been authorized by the person(s) quoted. It is unethical to use a person's image or her/his opinions of a product without getting his/her permission first. It is not acceptable to use an endorser's comments out of context. An example of this would be to use an out-dated endorsement for a brand-new product. It is unethical and misleading for a marketer to write customer testimonials. Customer testimonials should be written by customers, not employees of the company. Endorsements and testimonials are often more effective when they quote celebrities, but less famous people can be used for endorsements and testimonials as well.

It is an easy way to reach a highly targeted market. Short messaging service (SMS) is another name for text messaging. Text-message advertising is growing in popularity. However, it is not a form of broadcast media. Television and radio are the two forms of broadcast media. Marketers must get prior consent to send text messages to customers. Promotional messages sent via SMS must be short and to the point.

Place corrective advertising in the newspaper. It is likely that the business would be required to place corrective advertising in the same newspaper to advise readers that the original information was incorrect. The business would pay a fine to a government agency rather than to the newspaper. Unless there is a problem with the product, the business would not need to change its product specifications. A consent decree is a document that requires the business to stop running the advertisement without admitting any wrongdoing.

Charities, political parties, and pollsters are exempt from the national do-not-call list. The do-not-call provisions apply to any business that attempts to sell goods or services over the telephone. However, organizations that are collecting donations or information by phone are exempt from the do-not-call list. In the U.S., telemarketers may make calls only between the hours of 8:00 am and 9:00 pm local time, seven days a week. In Canada, they may make calls from 9:00 am to 9:30 pm local time, Monday through Friday, and from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm on weekends. Penalties for violating federal telemarketing regulations include monetary fines but not incarceration. If a firm has an established business relationship with a customer, it is allowed to call the customer even if s/he is on the do-not-call list. However, businesses may only be permitted to contact that customer during a certain time period following a transaction and/or interaction. The time period ranges from three to 18 months.

Giving expensive gifts to customers. Ethics are the beliefs or values that guide a person's behavior. Ethical behavior is important in business because customers don't buy from companies that they don't trust—companies that conduct business in an unethical manner. Some behavior falls into a gray area, meaning that it isn't right, but it isn't wrong, either. These gray areas are the reasons why businesses develop standards of ethics for their employees, including sales personnel, to use to guide their behavior in business situations. Giving expensive gifts is an example of an activity that falls into the gray area. Some businesses might view this activity as bribery, which is an unethical practice. Providing a price quote to a customer, offering to demonstrate a new product, and explaining how a product differs from others are examples of ethical selling activities.

Fraud. Fraud is a deception purposely carried out to secure unfair or unlawful gain. In a selling situation, fraud might occur if a salesperson does not disclose complete or accurate information about a product, and the customer bases his/her purchase decision upon the incomplete or inaccurate information. Reciprocity occurs when a business promises to purchase products from another business, if the other business promises to purchase certain products from it. Discrimination is the unfair treatment of a person or group based on the person's or group's characteristics (e.g., age, race, gender). Embezzlement is the theft of valuables that have been entrusted to one's care.

Cooling-off laws. A cooling-off law is a regulation that allows a buyer to withdraw from a sales contract within a specified timeframe (e.g., three days). Many levels of government establish cooling-off laws that vary in scope and type of sale. The purpose of the cooling-off law is to allow buyers a "grace period" to consider their purchases. One reason these laws exist is to protect consumers who fall prey to high-pressure sales tactics. Intensity ordinances, non-compete statutes, and transactional laws are not regulations that protect consumers from salespeople who use high-pressure sales tactics.

Financial loss. A tort is a personal wrongdoing against another person or a business. If a business faces a civil lawsuit due to a tort, it may experience negative publicity as well as credibility problems. And, if the business loses the lawsuit and must pay damages to the plaintiff, the business may experience substantial financial losses. The negative effects of a tort do not include tax deductions, monetary quotas, or economic changes.
