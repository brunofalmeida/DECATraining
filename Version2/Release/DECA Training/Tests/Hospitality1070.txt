1. B
Legally binding. In order for a contract to be legally binding, an offer must be made by one party and
accepted by the other party. In effect, the two parties are agreeing to the terms stated in the contract.
Then, both parties must live up to those terms. All contracts do not need to be notarized, put in written
form, or interpreted correctly.

2. C
Fiduciary. An agent is someone who acts on the behalf of another party. The agent often negotiates
contracts and handles legal issues for another person with that person's consent. The agent who shows
that s/he is loyal, trustworthy, and acting in the best interest of his/her client (principal) is fostering a
fiduciary relationship. Authoritative relationships are based on a particular level of control. Principal is a
legal term that describes the client. Legislative processes involve the procedures in which people or
governments establish laws.

3. C
To be informed about a destination's social conditions. Travel agents and tour operators have an
obligation to inform clients about the social and political conditions in a destination that they are
considering visiting. Clients have a right to know if there is political unrest, a threat of terrorism, or other
dangerous situations that might affect their travel plans or their safety. They should be made aware of
possible problems in order to make an informed decision as to whether to visit certain destinations.
Travel agents and tour operators usually do not discuss a competitor's refund policy. They often ask
customers if they want to buy trip insurance, but that is not considered a customer right. Travel to most
foreign countries is not dangerous. However, if travel to some areas is dangerous, customers have a
right to know.

4. A
Disintermediation. Traditionally, disintermediation has involved the elimination of intermediaries or
middlemen like Kathy. This results in the transfer of products directly from producers (in this case,
airlines) to the ultimate consumer. More broadly, though, disintermediation can include the displacement
of traditional intermediaries with new, radically different types of intermediaries such as online travel
agencies. The online travel agencies are successful because they can bring more value to consumers
than many traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies. A discrepancy of assortment is a difference
between the product lines that a firm offers and the assortment of products that the consumer wants.
Bulk-breaking involves dividing large quantities of products into smaller quantities as products move from
the producer to middlemen to consumers. There is no indication that bulk-breaking is occurring.
Exclusive distribution involves selling products through only one intermediary in a certain geographic
area. Since more than one firm is selling airline tickets in the geographic area, exclusive distribution is not
taking place.

Providing training programs. Positive channel relationships require collaboration among channel
members. Collaboration involves sharing relevant information, setting mutually-beneficial goals, and
developing a team-oriented attitude. Channel leaders have the most power or leverage in the channel,
and can implement tactics to foster positive relationships. Providing channel members with product
training programs helps channel members be successful in selling the products. Encouraging a
competitive culture among channel members, using aggressive tactics, and selling directly to end users
are more likely to create conflict and have a negative impact on channel relationships.

6. A
Critical feedback. When employees present their ideas to management or coworkers, they should be
prepared to defend those ideas and provide supporting information. They also should be willing to accept
critical feedback because others might not agree with the ideas or have different opinions. Being
prepared will help employees remain objective and be able to offer logical evidence to back up their
ideas. Critical feedback is often useful because it allows employees to view their ideas from a different
perspective. Defending ideas usually does not involve accepting additional responsibility or nonverbal
support. It is not acceptable to attack employees on a personal level because of their ideas.

7. C
To share many different opinions. Many businesses encourage employees to participate in group
discussions to analyze problems and find solutions. The advantage is that when employees share many
different opinions, there is an increase in the chance of developing useful recommendations. However,
for the group discussions to be useful, all members must feel comfortable and be willing to express their
opinions. Businesses do not make it possible for employees to participate in group discussions to discuss
personal issues, to plan extracurricular activities, or to have casual conversations.

8. D
Time. The system used or the way information is organized often depends on the type of information or
task at hand. In the example, the employee must track delinquent accounts. Because some accounts are
more overdue than other accounts the employee may use time as a method of organizing the
information. Each interval may require the employee to take a different action, such as mailing a late
notice to accounts that are 30 days past due, calling accounts that are 60 days past due, and turning
accounts over to collection agencies that are 90 days past due. Each action is based on a certain time
frame. The example does not indicate if the invoice numbers, locations, or names are organized in a

Understand the process you are explaining. In order to write accurate instructions, you must be
knowledgeable about the sequence and content of steps required for completion of the task. Instructions
should consist of simple, brief statements that are written from the employee's perspective. Although

the length of the instructions.

Accompany other written material. A transmittal letter is sent along with other documents or reports as an
introduction and explanation. The purpose of a transmittal letter is to identify what is being sent so that
the recipient will know what should be included and if any action needs to be taken. The other
alternatives would require letters that apply to the specific situation. A letter of congratulations would
extend good wishes, a letter of apology would make amends with a customer, and a sales letter would try
to sell specific products.

Make a decision. Informational messages are intended to inform and provide data to the recipients. In
many cases, the purpose of an informational message is to help the recipient make a decision. For this to
happen, the business employee should explain the situation and include sufficient data. If recipients
clearly understand the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the situation, they usually have
sufficient information to make a decision. Clear and concise writing enables a recipient to read the
message. The letterhead usually includes the business's name, address, and phone number so
recipients are able to contact the business. Explaining the situation and including sufficient data does not
guarantee that the recipient will agree with the content.

Employers. A customer-service mindset is the belief that giving customers good service should be a top
priority of a business. Without customers, there would be no need for employees. The business would
have to close, and you would be out of a job. You should, therefore, keep in mind that customers pay
your salary and are, in effect, your employers. Having a customer-service mindset does not involve
believing that your friends, associates, and relatives are your customers, although they may be at times.

Protect its customers' privacy. An ethical business implements strategies to protect its customers'
privacy. This is an important consideration to build long-term relationships with its customers, which
requires earning the customers' trust. One way for a business to earn its customers' trust is by
developing, implementing, communicating, and adhering to a customer privacy policy. Although privacy
policies vary by business, they might include limiting the access that employees have to customer
information and refusing to sell customer lists to third parties. If customers feel that the business respects
their privacy, they are more likely to trust the business and become loyal customers. Loyal customers
provide the business with repeat sales. A business can ask, but cannot require, its customers to provide
feedback. Offering exclusive benefits is a strategy that a business might use in customer relationship
management; however, this practice does not indicate or prove that the business is behaving in an
ethical manner.

Taxes. Taxes are monies that individuals and businesses must pay to the government. The purpose of
many taxes is to generate sufficient revenue for governments to pay for providing necessary services to
the public. Certain services, such as highway construction and maintenance, are beyond the capability of
individuals. Therefore, government takes responsibility for providing the services but needs the revenue
to do that which is the function of taxes. Generating sufficient revenue to pay for providing necessary
services to the public is not the reason for sales, prices, or quotas.

Advantages of using consensus building is that it encourages group members to communicate their ideas

Some digital records become inaccessible due to obsolete technology. The business's 2001 sales data
have become inaccessible due to obsolete technology—the floppy disk. Unless the business owner
saved the sales data in another form or can acquire a floppy disk drive, s/he simply cannot access the
data that the disk contains. Another drawback of electronic records is that constant use and rough
handling have the potential to damage some electronic media. However, there is no indication that the
floppy disk has been damaged; instead, it is simply an outdated form of technology. Digital records are
actually less expensive to store than paper records. There is no way to know if the data on the floppy disk
comply with government regulations, but, in general, businesses keep government regulations in mind
when creating and storing digital records.

Does the vendor have the resources to consistently meet our business's needs? A business that wants to
build a long-term relationship with a vendor must consider many factors. Most importantly, the business
must determine if the vendor has the resources to meet the business's needs. Some resources include
the product availability, technical-system compatibility, customer-service support, etc. The vendor's
project management computer program is not usually a primary consideration during the vendorselection
process. The business's own target market is a marketing consideration for the business rather
than for vendor selection. The business's strengths and weaknesses are identified in its SWOT analysis,
and do not directly relate to the vendor-selection process.

A hotel advertises a free breakfast buffet for guests on select mornings during slow seasons. Promotion
is defined as a marketing function that communicates information about goods, services, images, and/or
ideas to achieve a desired outcome. Advertising, coupons, frequent-buyer programs, and samples are a
few tools that marketers use to promote products. By advertising free goods and services (e.g., free
breakfast buffet), the hotel is implementing a promotional activity. A guest ordering room service or a
manager sending employees a memo regarding compensation information are not considered
promotional activities. A resort employee asking guests about room preferences is a selling activity.

Product positioning. Positioning is a product mix strategy in which a business creates a certain image or
impression of a product in the minds of consumers. In most cases, businesses want the image of the new
product to match the business's image and the image of its other products. Businesses create an overall
image that they project to consumers, and maintain that image by positioning new products accordingly.
It would confuse customers if a business with a low-cost image positioned a new product as expensive or
exclusive. Also, customers might not buy an expensive new product from a business with a low-cost
image. Promotional pricing is pricing goods/services at low levels and advertising them heavily. Creating
an economical image of a new product to match the business's low-cost image is not an example of
publicity planning or persuasive selling.

Valet parking. A service is an intangible product; one that can be felt, seen, heard, or experienced rather

guests' arrival or departure from the business (e.g., hotel, restaurant). Meals, airline tickets, and
electronic room keys are tangible items.

Product extensions. Product extensions occur when a business puts its name on a variety of products,
such as Oakley sunglasses, electronics, apparel, footwear, watches, etc. Businesses use these

to reach new customers, to keep a competitor from offering the product, and to refresh its image. The
Coleman Company is not monopolizing the outdoor market since it has a variety of competitors.
Upselling occurs when a salesperson sells a more expensive product than that originally requested by

Social bookmarks. Social bookmarks enable businesses to store, organize, search, share, and manage

include Digg, StumbleUpon, Delicious, Reddit, Technorati, and many others. Although e-mail could be
used to give this information to clients, it is not specific to this purpose. HTML, hypertext markup
language, is language used in developing websites. Search engine optimization, SEO, involves a variety

Detailed, accurate site map. A search engine is a software program that automatically crawls the Web
looking for information pertaining to specified search terms and displays a list of results. Businesses use
search-engine optimization strategies to obtain a good position in the search results. The key to search
engine optimization is designing and submitting web pages so that they can be found easily by search
engine spiders. A simple, yet effective, way to optimize a web site's ranking on the search engines is to
develop a detailed, accurate site map that helps the spiders to quickly and easily locate information
throughout the web site. Extensive use of JavaScript and widespread HTML code works against searchengine
optimization because these computer languages create barriers that spiders have difficulty
bypassing. The age of a web site usually has very little bearing on its ranking on search engines.

towards the top of advertising layouts to attract attention. White space is blank space that is good to use
in advertising layouts to unify the elements of an advertisement and to attract attention. The illustration is
used to attract attention and helps to lead the reader into the headline and copy.

Red, yellow, and orange. Color harmonies are the ways in which colors are combined on the page to

color red attracts the most attention visually, it tends to generate intense emotion and energy. Yellow also
attracts attention and tends to be an “optimistic” color. Because yellow is hard on the eyes, it should be
used sparingly. Orange is a mixture of red and yellow and often generates feelings of enthusiasm and
warmth. Blue and purple are cool colors that create a sense of calm and tranquility. Green is easiest on

homeless. That is a worthy cause that exists in many locales. The activity could then be publicized in a
press release on the restaurant's website and/or in the local newspaper. Buying books and uniforms are
also worthy causes but are not as good a fit as feeding the homeless. Many late-night airport arrivals are

Up-selling. Up-selling is a sales technique in which a higher priced product than the one originally
requested by the customer is suggested. The customer-service agent suggested that Maddie pay a bit
more for a higher priced business-class ticket rather than sitting in economy class, which is what Maddie
had planned to do. Affiliate marketing is the process of promoting and selling another business's products
on a web site in exchange for a sales commission. The ticket agent is selling her/his company's products,
not another business's merchandise. Comparison shopping is the act of visiting other businesses to learn
what competing stores are selling and the prices they charge. Maddie is not comparison shopping. A
trade-in allowance is a price reduction offered for selling back an old model of the product being
purchased. There is no indication that the airline would reduce the price of a business-class ticket for
Maddie.

Sleeping room or hostel. Sleeping rooms and hostels are inexpensive lodging alternatives that are
frequented by young adults and others who are interested in paying very little for their sleeping
accommodations. An extended-stay hotel is a mid-priced hotel that caters to guests who need
accommodations for an extended length of time. Although Frankie plans to be in Europe for three
months, he probably doesn't intend to stay in any one place for a long period of time. In addition,
extended-stay hotels, destination resorts, and timeshares are much more expensive than sleeping rooms
and hostels. Destination resorts are full-service hotels that provide additional attractions and recreational
alternatives for travelers. Timeshares are not necessarily resorts. Time shares are lodging properties that
sell their rooms to travelers for use each year during a specific period of time.
