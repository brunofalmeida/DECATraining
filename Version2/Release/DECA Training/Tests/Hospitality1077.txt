Resolve disputes. The legal procedure is the process of reviewing disputes or claims and resolving them
in a fair manner. Businesses are often involved in disputes with other entities, such as suppliers or
competitors. If a business believes it has been wronged by another, the business follows the appropriate
legal procedure to resolve the issue. Enacting legislation, establishing laws, and dissolving businesses
are not the main functions of the legal procedure.

Traffic. Tour-bus drivers must understand traffic laws in each jurisdiction where they travel because laws
differ by jurisdiction. For example, one city might allow a vehicle to turn left onto a one-way street at a red
light, while another city does not. If the driver does not understand and follow the law, the bus might be
involved in an accident that injures the tourists, other vehicles, and pedestrians. Airline pilots must
understand laws relating to airspace. Laws relating to shipping processes regulate the way certain
products are moved or transported. Property laws regulate the ways in which land and buildings are used
or maintained.

Use appropriate promotional techniques to inform channel members. Promotion is a critical consideration
when introducing a new product because this function lets channel members and customers know that
the good or service is available. The promotional efforts should be carefully planned and coordinated with
the product's release. For example, a manufacturer might provide catalogs, brochures, coop-advertising
funds, and product training to its intermediaries (e.g., dealers, wholesalers) before the product is released
so that the intermediaries can explain the products to their customers or end users. Some channel
members (e.g., retailers) might need to coordinate promotion so that newspaper and television
advertising or special events are appropriately timed with the product's arrival on the stores' shelves. If
the communication between a manufacturer and its intermediaries is already very good, the manufacturer
needs to continue using good communication rather than improve it. Applying for a line of credit is a
financial consideration. Ethics policies must not only be established, but they must communicated to the
appropriate people or organizations.

Smile. A smile shows the speaker that you support and encourage him/her. It is a good idea to ask
questions when asked. It shows interest in the topic. A straight face is difficult for a speaker to interpret. It

presentation is rude to the speaker and may cause him/her to lose his/her train of thought.

She gave out a guest's room number. Although Dawn was courteous with the caller, she was distracted
by the fact that the caller seemed upset and said the call was about an emergency. In her haste to be
helpful, she forgot that she should try to locate the guest, not give out her room number, even in what

call and to ring the guest's room before transferring the caller to the guest's voicemail, especially in an

Identifying the sequential steps of a process. When describing activities that need to be done in a specific
order, the writer might want to number the steps to set the process apart from the text and to clarify the
process. One testimonial or a single piece of information does not require a numerical designation to
reinforce the order of content. Charts are graphics that summarize numerical data. A narrative writing
format is usually most appropriate when providing an example to clarify a concept.

Possible objections. The purpose of a persuasive letter is to convey information that encourages the
reader to take a specific course of action. For example, the purpose of a sales letter is to motivate a
person to buy a particular product. An objection is a reason for not taking a specific course of action.
When developing persuasive messages, it is important for the writers to think about the readers' possible
objections and acknowledge them. By acknowledging the objections and providing a rationale that
removes the objections, the writers better position themselves in persuading the readers to take specific
actions. Because each reader has different personal images and decision-making styles, it is not feasible
for the writer to consider these factors if the letter is going to a lot of people. The readers' nonverbal cues
cannot be seen when writing persuasive messages.

Grapevine. The grapevine is an oral communication method in which information is passed around the
company but not formally announced or verified. Employees often communicate with each other through
the grapevine and pass on accurate information about developments within the business. The problem
with the grapevine is that sometimes the message is incorrect. Businesses often communicate formally
with employees through the company newsletter or an official memorandum. The Internet is a worldwide
interconnection of computer networks.

Repeat business. Employees who solve customers' problems quickly and satisfactorily often are able to
obtain repeat business from those customers. Customers who are well treated will likely return to the

experience when employees quickly handle problems and complaints.

Personalized activity schedules. A competitive advantage is the edge that businesses achieve when they
can offer something better than their competitors. A business that provides a service, or a better type of
service, often has an advantage over competitors that do not provide the same service. Offering
personalized activity schedules may persuade customers to buy from that cruise line. A business that
does not have a competitive advantage if it offers room service or standard products that are provided by
other, similar businesses. Open-door policy is a business practice whereby management encourages

Production. The movement of goods, services, and resources is possible because of four economic
activities: consumption, production, exchange, and distribution. In order for consumption to occur, goods
and services must be made or produced. Production relies on consumers to provide resources, and
consumption relies on producers to provide goods and services. Opportunity is a chance or benefit.
Financing is a marketing function that involves understanding the financial concepts used in making
business decisions. Management is the process of coordinating resources in order to accomplish an

Information about prices. Information about prices is necessary in deciding whether to buy, what to buy,
and how much to buy. Information is one of the functions of relative prices. Economic incentives are
monetary motivators that encourage producers to change and reallocate their resources. In our economy,
these incentives are profit. Rationing is a function of relative prices that determines who gets the goods
and services produced or how scarce resources will be distributed. Limited liability is a condition in which
business owners risk only the amount of their investment.

The manager of a restaurant selects the monthly menu and designs a newspaper advertisement.
Selecting the menu and designing an advertisement represent a variety of tasks and also a high degree
of latitude concerning decision making. The relationship of scope and depth can change with a specific
task, so the amounts of scope and depth vary at different times. A manager developing a monthly work
schedule is an example of high depth. Signing time cards is low scope. Following guidelines to evaluate

Guide the actions of others. Individuals who are leaders not only have the ability to decide what needs to

organize their work, but that is not what makes them good leaders. Analyzing employee productivity is
often a responsibility of leaders rather than a personality trait. Displaying empathy by feeling what others
are feeling is a desirable personality trait but does not indicate leadership.

a means of accumulating wealth. Negotiating is the process of resolving a disagreement. Bartering

Credit report, credit bureau. Because businesses often base their decisions about extending credit or
providing a loan on credit history, it is important for individuals and businesses to periodically check and
ensure that their credit information is accurate. Credit history is provided in the form of a credit report. By
reviewing the credit report, individuals and businesses can determine if there are any problems (e.g.,
identity theft) or discrepancies on the report that need resolved. Credit reports are available through
recognized credit bureaus or agencies, which maintain files of credit information on individuals and
businesses. Credit histories are not documented on bank statements, lending statements, or credit
certificates. The primary purpose of financial institutions, tax agencies, and credit unions is not to
maintain comprehensive credit histories for individuals and businesses.

To hire additional staff. Managers use accounting information in making effective financial decisions

decide to hire additional staff because profits have increased. Businesses do not use the information

inventory.

Revenue. Revenue is the money received by resource owners and by producers for supplying goods and
services to consumers. Revenue is an important component of an income statement because it indicates
the total amount of money a business earns from all sources such as sales, interest, and dividends. A
business's revenue should exceed its expenses in order for the business to make a profit. Taxes are
calculated on the net income determined by the income statement. Assets are anything of value that a
business owns. Liabilities are debts that a business owes.

34. C
Censorship. Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a
common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an
extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any
cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another
member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin
to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the "good of the group."
Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do. In
today's competitive business environment, the pressure to earn high profits has often resulted in
fraudulent behavior, embezzlement, money laundering, etc. Such actions are often a result of groupthink
conditions. Empathy is the ability to place oneself in another person's place or circumstances. Empathy is
not a characteristic of groupthink, which embraces harmonious or like-minded thinking.

A competitive advantage. When a tour company acquires up-to-date, relevant marketing information from
reputable sources, it can make thoughtful business decisions and take action to offer new travel
products, increase its profits, and gain market share. A tour company that takes steps to increase its
market share may gain a competitive advantage, which is the edge achieved by the business for offering
something better or different from its competitors. Quality assurance is the process by which a business
achieves its desired level of quality. Balance of trade is the difference between the value of a nation's
exports and its imports. Although favorable business decisions should provide the business with more

Tax change. Governments that raise hotel or sales tax rates can affect a region's hospitality and tourism.
If the tax rates are too high, vacationers or tourists are more likely to travel to destinations that have

unemployment rate are economic factors that can affect the hospitality and tourism industry. Terrorism is
a political factor.

25%. It is important for hospitality and tourism businesses and organizations to measure and analyze the
composition of various markets to determine how to best market their services to different market
segments. The businesses or organizations' objectives, the market segment's demographics, and the
size of the market segment affect how much money they will allocate to various marketing activities for a
particular market segment. To determine the percentage size of the international market during peak
season, first divide the number of domestic tourists during peak season by the total market to obtain the
percentage of domestic visitors during peak season (562,875 ÷ 750,500 = .75 or 75%). Then, subtract
the percentage of domestic visitors during peak season by the total market to obtain the percentage of
international visitors during peak season (100 % - 75% = 25%).

Provide the interviewers with training. It is important for hospitality businesses (e.g., resorts) to train

risks associated with interviewer bias and error, which can affect the interviewees' answers. Asking only
close-ended questions will not provide in-depth, qualitative feedback. Limiting the length of the interview
and allowing the interviewers to develop and ask their own questions can negatively affect the integrity of
the information the interviewers collect.

Decide to buy. There are several techniques that business employees can use to motivate customers to
make the decision to buy. One of these involves appealing to customers on a personal level by creating a
feeling of ownership for a product. When employees use this technique, they talk about the product in
terms of the customer using the product by including words such as "you" and "your." Customers often
feel a sense of ownership and are motivated to buy. Other ways to involve customers on a personal level
to motivate them to buy is by having them participate in a demonstration or handle a product. Employees
do not motivate customers to pay a higher price for a product.

Variable. Travel and tourism marketing involves the marketing of services to customers who participate in
producing and experiencing the services. As a result, the service varies for each customer. For example,
one person's experience with an escorted tour might be completely different from another person's
experience. Furthermore, the way the service is marketed varies depending on the target market. For
example, a travel agency might market a luxury cruise to senior citizens and a Disney cruise to families
with young children. Consequently, the marketing varies, and the outcome is often unpredictable. It is not
a precise, controllable, or standard process because of the many variables.

Identify a target market. Many hotels maintain guest-history records from information guests provide on
their registration cards. When these records are kept up-to-date, the hotel has an accurate profile of its

or control the hotel's expenses. Housekeeping may be improved if guest complaints are recorded and
acted upon, but that is not a purpose of guest records.

Report. Employees should report not only injurious accidents to their supervisors but also accidents that
do not result in injuries. Employees must report non-injury accidents because the same accident may
happen again, and the next time it may cause an injury. As a general safety precaution, hazardous
conditions and hazardous acts should also be reported. Employees should not ignore non-injury
accidents. Employees may discuss non-injury accidents after they report them. Employees do not treat
non-injury accidents because no one was injured.

Track deadlines. Meeting deadlines is an important part of successfully completing a project. Project
managers need to track deadlines because one part of a project often needs to be completed before
another part can begin. For example, a location must be selected before an event can take place. If the
deadlines are not met, the project cannot proceed. Project managers do not necessarily need to seek
input, recruit staff, or develop options because one part of a project needs to be completed before
another part can begin.

Delivery timeliness. When selecting a supplier, businesses must consider delivery timeliness. The
business must ask if the supplier can deliver the goods when they are needed. In some situations, it may
be better for a business to use a supplier who may be a little more expensive, but in closer physical
proximity of the business, if that supplier can consistently meet delivery requirements. Personnel policies
are guidelines for employees' behavior in the workplace. The exchange rate is the value of one nation's
currency in relation to another nation's currency. Return on sales or target return is a profit-oriented
pricing objective in which the business bases the amount of profit it wants to earn on the amount of its
sales.

Avoid direct skin contact and wear disposable gloves. To protect from bacteria transmission and skin

Housekeeping attendants generally alert their manager when cleaning-chemical inventory is low and do

or ventilation masks may need to be used. It is not necessary for attendants to keep a log of ingredients
found in the cleaning materials; the ingredients are listed on the cleanser storage containers.

Obey the demands. Most robbers are interested only in obtaining cash and leaving the business as
quickly as possible so as not to be identified. Business employees should obey the robber's demands
and be cooperative in order to avoid a situation that might result in violence. The employees should
consider their own personal safety first because the business probably carries insurance for such events.
It may be impossible for employees to call the police or adjust the alarm system during a robbery without
putting themselves in danger. They should obey the robber's demand rather than try to hide the cash.

Targets of crime. Tourists are often easy to identify because of the way they dress and behave and
because of the sites and attractions they visit. For example, tourists in certain parts of the world are
easily recognized because they do not look like the local people, and they do not speak the language.
Furthermore, the perception often is that tourists carry a lot of money and are not particularly careful.
Also, tourists may not be aware of high-crime districts and accidentally walk into those areas. All of these
factors set up tourists as targets of crime. As a result, the travel and tourism industry stresses security
and tries to prepare tourists for possible problems. For example, tour operators may point out areas of
cities that the group should avoid, or cruise ships might tell passengers to use only certain taxis in ports
of call. Tourists are not looking for trouble, nor are they any more prone to injury than other people. Many
tourists travel only with family members rather than as part of a group.

Computer. Today, most businesses expect employees to have at least basic computer skills because
many business functions and activities involve the use of computers. Businesses communicate with
employees, customers, and vendors by e-mail. Many businesses have web sites and offer online
ordering. As a result, most employees need to know how to use a computer even if only to send an
e-mail or to access a competitor's web site. Accounting, management, and legal skills are more
specialized. Therefore, most employees are not expected to have these skills.

Yes. Businesses in the hospitality and tourism industry can start small and expand. There are lots of
opportunities for people to dream and actualize those dreams when they open their businesses. Not all

Network with others who have expertise in the industry. A trade association is a group of persons in the
same industry or geographic area who form a society to solve their common problems. Because Lisa is a
business owner, she might join a hospitality and tourism trade association to network with others who
work in the hospitality and tourism industry. By networking with others who have expertise in that
industry, Lisa has an opportunity to get ideas that will help her business grow. She may also get advice
about how to solve problems and deal with difficult issues that occur in the industry. Although some trade
associations provide certification, they are not a means to earn a college degree. A trade association
might help Lisa locate financial sources, but it would not extend credit to her so she can purchase
equipment. As a business owner, the primary reason Lisa should join a trade association is to discuss
professional business with colleagues rather than personal issues.

Hotel room prices vary and depend on many factors, such as supply and demand. Rates (price) change
and vary greatly in the hospitality industry. When demand is high, such as during certain seasons, the
rates tend to be higher. The facility location, the room size, the room type, and the type of guest the
facility attracts also affect the room rates. Members of groups, conventions, and organization affiliations
(e.g., AAA) often obtain discounts from hotels. Travelers who regularly frequent a specific hotel receive
discounts. Therefore, price varies and is affected by the demand for and supply of rooms at any given
time. Because rates change often, hotels must manage the price function carefully. Rates can vary
greatly among hotels at any given time. Convention groups' needs vary, and the hotel facility works with
each group to negotiate rates.

Modifying existing products. Developing new products often is an ongoing process that involves
modifying existing products in some way. Modifications might include making a product more powerful,
changing the color of a product, or creating a slightly different version of a product. For example, a

product. Marketing specialty products, manufacturing convenience goods, and merchandising retail

Annual rate of consumption. The annual rate of consumption refers to the quantity that must be replaced
each year because of loss or damage. Cruise lines calculate the average amount of linens and towels
that must be replaced over a period of a year. Because these items wear out or are lost throughout the
year, cruise lines often set up schedules for buying. For example, a cruise line might place an order every
quarter to make sure new linens and towels are available when needed. The preferences of passengers
might have an effect on the type and quality of linens and towels that a cruise line buys. The cruise line's
relationship with vendors might have an effect on the price of goods and delivery date. The style of
passenger cabin might have an effect on the quality of the items.

customers rely on rational reasoning. Salespeople have a great ability to influence customers' buying
decisions by recommending specific products. Customers don't necessarily make buying decisions within
the first minute of a sales presentation.

Answering as quickly as possible. Instead, the salesperson should pause before answering objections
rather than rushing to answer. A salesperson should let customers say what they feel and listen carefully
to everything customers are saying. They should empathize with customers' feelings and appreciate their
point of view. Objections can often be turned into selling points, which are reasons to buy.

Suggestion selling. The server is attempting to increase the purchase by offering tempting desserts.
Follow-up is sales activities which occur after a sales presentation or a sale has been made to ensure
customer satisfaction. Prospecting is the act of identifying any person or organization with the potential to
buy a product and compiling that information in an organized manner for future use. Feature-benefit
selling is convincing customers that a good or service has the features that will provide the benefits for
which they are looking.

Attitude. A customer's attitude or feeling towards a certain product is usually developed through
experience over time. Attitudes are often difficult to change, particularly if a customer is not dissatisfied
with a current product. To change a customer's attitude, a salesperson must be able to convince the
customer that the new product has advantages and benefits not available in the competing product.
Ethics are the basic principles that govern a person's behavior. Training is developing a certain skill. A
complaint is a customer's expression of a dissatisfaction.

During check-in. Hotel employees should inform guests of the hotel's services and amenities during the
check-in process. Guests who are not aware that the hotel offers certain services will not use them,
which can affect the guests' experience during their stay and can affect the hotel's sales. For example, a
guest who does not realize that the hotel has an on-site restaurant will not dine there. As a result, the
hotel's food and beverage division loses potential revenue. Advising guests about services during
checkout is not beneficial to the guest or to the hotel. Posting is a term that describes adding or
subtracting charges to a guest's bill.

$85.06. Many restaurants offer special prices on certain types of dinners to attract customers. Customers
order those dinners because they are priced lower than usual. If customers also have coupons for
discounts, the restaurant calculates the discount to determine the total cost. In this example, the
restaurant is offering lobster dinners for $22.99. A table of four orders the dinners, but two of the
customers have coupons for discounts. To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount
amount from the cost of the two dinners. To determine the amount of discount, add the cost of the two
dinners and calculate the 15% discount ($22.99 x 2 = $45.98; $45.98 x 15% or .15 = $6.897 or $6.90).
Then, subtract the discount from the cost of the two dinners ($45.98 - $6.90 = $39.08). Add the
discounted price of the two dinners to the regular price of the other two dinners to calculate the total cost
for the table ($39.08 + $22.99 + $22.99 = $85.06).
