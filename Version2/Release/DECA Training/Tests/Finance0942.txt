Credit transactions. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a large set of business laws that clarified and modernized many laws relating to commercial transactions. These model laws, which have been adopted by most states, govern the way that companies do business with each other and with consumers. One transaction regulated by the UCC is credit and includes the credit terms that businesses offer to customers as well as installment sales contracts. The Uniform Commercial Code makes it easier for companies to do business in other states because the laws governing commercial transactions are the same. The UCC does not regulate business competition, economic policies, or product development.

Implementing an automatic identification system. An automatic identification system uses electronic bar coding symbols to transmit information. Businesses often use bar coding as a way to keep track of their inventory and reorder stock. Bar coding eliminates the need to process inventory manually, which takes much more time and is subject to a higher rate of error. Although tracking shipping expenses through a database system and developing web sites require technology to operate, products do not necessarily move through the distribution chain more efficiently. Use of networked trading communities can potentially increase the efficiency of product movement. However, merely encouraging use of networked systems does not increase product movement efficiency.

Ethical business practices. Studies have shown a strong relationship between customer satisfaction and a company's ethical behavior. Building customer loyalty gives a business a competitive advantage and is profitable. Taking care of employees tends to encourage employees to take care of business. Paying higher wages is not the only requirement for employee commitment. Pricing strategies can ensure profit but have little impact on employee commitment and customer loyalty. Customer satisfaction, employee contentment, and profit are not directly linked to automated distribution centers.

Type of product. A business considers several factors when selecting a channel of distribution. One important factor involves the type of product because different channels of distribution are more effective for certain types of products. For example, a direct channel of distribution might work better for perishable products, while an indirect channel would be satisfactory for durable items that have a long shelf life. Businesses do not consider the return process, the size of the sales force, or the credit policy when selecting a channel of distribution.

Basic information. Businesses often write letters of inquiry to other businesses to request information and literature, or to order goods or services. These types of letters are routine and should contain only the information the receiver needs in order to respond. It is not necessary to provide complex instructions or technical explanations when writing routine letters. Letters of inquiry usually do not contain confidential data because they are making requests rather than providing information.

Short. A characteristic of a simple written report is that it usually is short and to the point. The purpose of writing simple reports is to present basic information in an abbreviated form so that the recipients can read it quickly and use the information in their decision making. Simple written reports are informal rather than formal. They should address the issue in simple terms rather than present abstract information. Simple written reports provide the basic points rather than detailed information.

Annual report. An annual report is a type of complex written report that contains a wide range of information about the status of a business. Many large businesses prepare annual reports in order to inform stockholders about profits and losses, product developments, and goals for the future. Annual reports usually are lengthy, contain complex information, and are organized into sections. A service report is a short report prepared by a worker to explain what services were rendered to a customer. A credit report provides credit information about a business or an individual. A news report is a short article about a factual event.

Stick to a planned agenda. Having an agenda of items to be discussed, being prepared to discuss the agenda items, and keeping the group on target with the agenda are essential to effective staff meetings. The individual conducting the meeting should plan the agenda. Asking attendees to prepare their own agendas would create chaos. Robert's Rules of Order are parliamentary procedures to follow in a meeting that involves voting on issues. Minutes are reports of what happened in a meeting, and they are distributed after the meeting takes place.

The nature of the business. A business's policies must be appropriate for the type of business. For example, a policy that might be appropriate for an investment business might be inappropriate for a hardware store. Not all business policies are written, and it would not be necessary to display them. The personal preferences of management should not be a consideration. Not all employees in a business need to have accounting skills.

Shopping. Shopping goods are consumer goods that are purchased by consumers after comparing goods and stores in order to get the best quality, price, and/or service. Consumers tend to pay more for shopping goods than for convenience goods, and they usually want the advice of a salesperson. Convenience goods, such as milk and bread, generally are purchased quickly and without much thought or effort. Industrial goods are items purchased by producers for resale, to make other goods, and/or to use in business operations. Specialty goods have unique characteristics that consumers are willing to pay higher prices to buy them.

Increasing taxes. A contractionary fiscal policy is intended to control or decrease growth in an economy that is expanding too fast. One way that a government might decrease growth is by increasing taxes. When businesses and individuals pay more taxes, they have less money to spend on other goods and services. Therefore, demand for products decreases, production decreases because of less demand, and the economy slows down.

Trade. Each purchase strengthens the economy by encouraging trade. Purchases do not necessarily encourage expansion, investment, or competition. Expansion is an action an individual firm might take to increase sales—or purchases. Either individuals or firms may invest at any time, whether or not customers buy products. In the struggle to lead a market, competition can encourage customers to buy products.

$3.50. Marginal cost is the change in cost involved in increasing or decreasing production. It is often used to calculate the extra cost of producing one more item. In this situation, total cost of operating the business is $3,000 before any items are produced. Once production begins, there are additional costs. To determine the marginal cost of producing each additional item, first calculate the change in total cost by subtracting the total cost before production from the total cost once production begins ($6,500 - $3,000 = $3,500). The change in total cost is $3,500 from zero production to producing 1,000 items. To calculate marginal cost, divide the change in total cost by the number of items produced ($3,500 ÷ 1,000 = $3.50).

Economic goal. Governments develop economic policies in order to achieve certain economic goals. An example of an economic goal is price stability. When prices are stable, there are no major changes in price levels. As a result, prices remain fairly constant, or stable. This is also an indication that the economy is stable and the government's economic policies are effective. Price stability is not an example of a business theory, an industry standard, or a monetary law.

Purchasing power. Inflation, which is a rise in prices, often has a negative effect on a business's purchasing power because now it takes more money to buy the same item. As a result, the business is able to buy less with the same amount of money. For example, as the inflation rate increases, $1 might only be able to buy $ .90 or $ .80 worth of goods. The business spends more money to buy the same items. High levels of inflation do not have a negative effect on a business's credit rating, import quota, or secondary market.

Expansion is the stage of the business cycle characterized by increased spending and borrowing, increased demand for goods and services, increased employment rates, and decreased interest rates on loans. Inflation is a rapid rise in prices, usually occurring when demand exceeds supply.

The ways that people form/conduct relationships with one another. Relationships between people are often very complex and can be either effective or ineffective. Effective human relations are characterized by the ability of people to get along with one another. Public relations are activities sponsored by a business to create and/or foster a positive image. The number of people with whom you come in contact on a daily basis has nothing to do with how you get along with those people.

Recognition. Recognition is special notice or attention. Giving an employee sincere praise, compliments, and positive feedback is an example of providing recognition. This type of recognition is often informal because it is unexpected. However, informal recognition is often more appreciated because it is spontaneous such as a positive comment from a supervisor. A reward is a tangible item given for someone's service or accomplishment. Giving an employee sincere praise, compliments, and positive feedback is not an example of providing support or training. However, feedback might be supportive or involve some type of training.

Often buy impulse items more freely. Credit encourages customers to buy more freely. Credit customers like being able to buy without worrying about whether they have the cash on hand to pay for their purchases. As a result, they may buy impulse items that catch their attention. Store profit is affected by credit customers, who often spend less time making buying decisions than other customers. Credit accounts are not always paid on time, and, for the retailer, collecting past-due accounts is a disadvantage of the credit system.

Measurable. A goal is a desired outcome. Investment goals are desired financial outcomes. Because financial goals deal with money, and money is needed to run the business, it is important that the accounting firm's owner have the means to monitor the progress of his/her investment goals in a tangible, measurable way. Investment goals do not need to be conservative. An accounting firm's owner can set general goals, but specific goals are needed to accomplish the general goal. Investment at any level is risky, so the exact outcome is often unknown. Therefore, investment goals are obtainable rather than accurate.

Human. The chances of loss that result from human weakness and unpredictability are known as human risks. One of the greatest human risks faced by businesses is theft, which includes theft by customers, vendors, and employees. Economic risks are caused by changes in the market that force a lowering of prices, a change of product, or even failure of businesses. Natural risks result from natural causes such as fire, weather conditions, and perishability. Personal is not a classification of risk.

Creditors. Creditors utilize the information generated from a profit-and-loss statement to review the financial status of a business. Creditors are responsible for deciding if a business is granted a loan, or a cash advance, and want to make sure a business has the cash flow to repay a loan. Top executives and managers use the information in making decisions about operations and how to run the company efficiently. Investors would not be of concern in this situation since the company is privately owned.

To help the business control its spending. A budget shows how much income a business expects to receive and how much its expenses are estimated to be for a particular time period. This helps the business to keep from spending more than its income. Controlling its cash flow helps a business to be successful, which may enable it to offer credit to customers; but that is not the purpose of a budget. Budgets do not increase sales or production, but they reflect the results of such increases.

Accounting systems. Accounting systems are methods and procedures used in handling the business's financial information. Businesses need accounting systems to track financial activities and collect financial data that are needed to prepare financial statements. All businesses prepare some type of financial statements such as profit-and-loss statements, and tax returns. Accounting systems capture the information needed to prepare these records. Operating budgets, balance sheets, and depreciation records are examples of financial statements that many businesses prepare.

Source documents. Businesses keep a variety of source documents to use as evidence of financial transactions. Source documents are a type of business record. An example of a source document is a check that a business writes to pay a supplier. The canceled check is evidence that a financial transaction was completed between the business and a supplier. An income statement is a summary of a business's income and expenses over a period of time. A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial condition of the business at that particular moment. A sales budget is an estimate of expenses and income that can be expected from the sale of a business's goods and services.

To prevent shortages. Evaluating cash-handling techniques is important because ineffective methods often lead to losses for the business. For example, a business might decide to stop paying cash for small purchases as a result of evaluating that procedure and discovering that many times those payments were not recorded. The business spent money and has no record of the expense which results in a shortage of cash. Auditing payments, reconciling deposits, and counting change funds are cash-handling techniques that businesses might evaluate.

Verify invoices. Before businesses authorize payment to vendors, they verify the information on the invoices to make sure they are paying the correct amount for the number of items ordered. Once businesses are satisfied that the invoices are correct, they authorize payment. Businesses negotiate terms during the purchasing process and these terms should appear on the invoice. The terms might include discounts which will be clearly stated on the invoice. Once payment is authorized, the business will process a check.

Availability of cash. Accounts payable are all the monies a business owes to others. In order to pay these accounts, businesses need cash. As a result, businesses usually try to control their accounts payable to correspond to the availability of cash. If a business knows money will be coming in, it can plan to make purchases because it will be able to pay its bills when they are due. Businesses do not control their accounts payable by monitoring the value of assets, the amount of credit to extend, or the type of raw materials.

Dollar amounts. Long-term debts are those debts, or liabilities, that will be paid off over a period of years. These debts or liabilities have value that must be recorded on a business's financial statements. When a business values long-term debt, it is assigning dollar amounts to liabilities. For example, a six-year loan in the amount of $60,000 might be valued at $50,000 in the second year if the business had paid off $10,000 of the debt. When a business values long-term debt, it is not assigning income, operating costs, or profit to liabilities.

Bonds. Businesses sometimes issue bonds to obtain long-term capital or funds. Bonds are a type of long-term debt that a business repays at a specified time with interest.

Stocks are shares, or units, of ownership in a corporation. A loan is a sum of money lent to a business for a specific time period that is repayable with interest.

Offering a discount for prompt payment. If a business is offering a sales discount, it clearly states the terms of the discount on the customer's statement such as 5/15, n30. This tells the customer that 5% can be deducted from the amount due if the customer pays within 15 days. When businesses prepare customer statements, they often indicate if sales discounts are available. Sales discounts encourage customers to pay quickly to reduce the amount of the invoice. The term 5/15, n30 tells the customer that payment is due in full within 30 days. The term 5/15, n30 does not tell the customer that the business is charging a 5% penalty for late payment or adding sales tax to the amount of the purchase.

Customer files bankruptcy. In some situations, businesses will be unable to collect receivables. Businesses routinely evaluate customers and their payment histories to identify situations that might affect collecting receivables. For example, if a customer files bankruptcy, a business might decide that it will be unable to collect all or part of the amount it is owed by the customer. Customers often relocate and notify businesses of their new addresses. Businesses maintain a variety of sales documents so losing the original invoice does not mean that a business will be unable to collect receivables. If a receivable becomes uncollectible, a business usually eliminates the debt.

Types and amounts of deductions. Businesses maintain payroll records for each employee that contain information about hours worked, wages, payroll date, type and amount of deductions, etc. Businesses maintain employee earnings records to be able to accurately compensate employees for their time and effort.

Allocating payroll costs. Businesses need to have cash to cover payroll costs. When businesses pay employees, they deduct the amount of the payroll from cash assets. By doing this, businesses are able to keep track of the amount of cash they have on hand to pay expenses. Employees' wages and salaries are business expenses rather than personal expenses. Businesses do not estimate payroll earnings because employees are paid the correct amount for the hours they work. Businesses determine pay rates for each type of job before hiring employees to fill those positions.

Straight-line. The simplest and easiest method of depreciating an asset is the straight-line depreciation method. This method is based on depreciating an asset by an equal amount for each year of the asset's life. After that time, the asset has no value. For example, a business that depreciates a $100,000 asset by $20,000 each year for five years is using the straight-line method of depreciation. The partial-asset, accelerated-value, or double-declining methods do not depreciate an asset by an equal amount for each year of the asset's life.

Net sales. Net sales are total sales minus discounts, sales returns, and allowances. Offering discounts is a sales policy that impacts the net sales category of a business's income statement because businesses include only the amounts that customers actually pay for products. If a product sells for $50 and the business offers a 10% discount, the product actually sells for $45. Therefore, the discount impacts the net sales figure which is now $45 instead of $50. Gross profit is the money left after cost of goods expense is subtracted from total income. Operating expenses are all of the expenses involved in running a business. Cost of goods sold is the amount of money a business pays for the product it will sell.

In the currency of Country A. When a business in one country buys products from a business in another country, the two businesses must agree on the currency that will be used to pay for the products. Businesses often want to pay for purchases in the currency of their country, such as in U.S. dollars, to avoid a problem if the exchange rate changes. For example, if the exchange rate changes and the currency of Country B is worth more than the currency of Country A, the business in Country A will pay more for the products if it has agreed to pay in the currency of Country B. This results in a loss for the business in Country A. Paying by certified check will not prevent an exchange loss unless the check is in the currency of Country A. A business can use a credit memorandum only if it has a credit with another company.

Accounts receivable. Liquidity refers to a business's ability to turn assets into cash. Accounts receivable, all the monies owed to a business by its customers, are assets that a business might be able to sell to generate cash. Selling accounts receivable to a third party is one way to turn assets into cash. Cost of goods sold is the amount of money a business pays for the product it will sell. Accounts payable are all monies owed by the business to others. Credit rating has an impact on a business's ability to obtain loans.

Amount of inventory it will sell. Businesses prepare a sales budget because this budget is the basis for the other budgets. The sales budget is an estimate of sales and revenue over a period of time, often one year. When preparing a sales budget, a business estimates the amount of inventory it will sell over that period of time. By estimating the inventory it will sell, a business can put an estimated dollar figure on estimated revenue. Once a business completes the sales budget, it can prepare the purchases budget to plan for the amount of money it will need to buy the inventory that it expects to sell. Businesses do not estimate the number of repeat customers or the dates of planned deliveries when preparing a sales budget.

Advertising. Businesses prepare selling expenses budgets to account for all the expenses associated with selling.

Insurance and maintenance expenses are usually listed in the general and administrative expenses budget.

15%. Businesses use financial ratios to evaluate the company's performance. One important ratio is the return on sales ratio, which indicates a business's profitability. To calculate the return on sales ratio, divide net profit by sales ($135,000 ÷ $900,000 = 0.15 or 15%). In this example, the business is earning a 15% profit. By comparing this figure to industry averages, a business can determine if it is earning an acceptable amount of profit.

Paying cash dividends to investors. Businesses that sell stock usually pay cash dividends to investors. This distribution of cash must be accounted for in the business's financial statements. Since cash is an asset and businesses pay dividends out of cash, they record the payment of dividends as a decrease in assets. The overall assets of the business might increase if the business earns enough profit to pay dividends; however, the payment of dividends decreases those assets. Businesses do not list a disbursement of funds as a decrease in assets when allocating funds among projects, estimating value of current acquisitions, or determining future financing needs.

Attract and to retain talented workers. A business with a reputation for treating its employees fairly is much more likely to get and to keep good workers. This benefit of managing diversity will be especially important if predictions for the continued shrinking of the labor pool of educated/skilled workers are accurate. Businesses that manage diversity well have a diverse workforce rather than a homogeneous workforce. Managing a diverse workforce is more difficult and takes more of managers' time than managing a homogeneous workforce. A business would not want to reduce its levels of productivity.

They also maintain information about the reasons for any returns or customer complaints. Businesses monitor this information in order to make marketing decisions such as whether to carry a larger quantity of a certain item or to discontinue some items. Businesses do not maintain information about inventory levels, the types of products that customers are buying, and the reasons for any returns in order to contact new vendors, develop display ideas, or update promotional materials.

People did not answer all of the questions. In many cases, processing marketing information involves tabulating the results of a survey. Tabulating is counting the number of respondents who answered each question with one of the possible answers. For example, if 100 people responded to a survey, businesses need to know how many of them agreed, disagreed, or had no opinion about the questions. Also, tabulating helps businesses to determine if some people did not answer all the questions, which might have an effect on the accuracy of the results. Tabulating the information in a marketing survey will not help a business determine if some questions were difficult to understand or if the questions required lengthy answers. Surveys often are anonymous and do not require people to provide their names.

Technology is advancing. Marketers must be aware that situations can change and be prepared to make changes in marketing strategies when they are needed. Many factors can necessitate a change in marketing strategy, such as advancements in technology. The development of new products or new ways of doing business might make it necessary for a company to change its marketing strategy in order to be successful. If the economy is stable, consumers are satisfied; and if competition is limited, businesses might successfully use the same marketing strategies for many years.

Geographic segmentation is the division of a market on the basis of where consumers are located. Socioeconomics is not a method of selecting a target market.

Opportunities. A situational analysis involves examining and interpreting the environmental factors that affect a business. As a result of considering the environmental factors, a business often is able to identify potential threats in the marketplace, such as increasing competition or a sluggish economy. Once a business identifies the specific threats, it takes steps to turn them into opportunities. For example, if the economy is beginning to slow down, a business might revise its products or offer additional credit plans to appeal to a wider market. Sales strategies are plans of action for achieving sales goals. Objectives are goals to be reached. Accounting tactics are specific actions that will be used to carry out accounting strategies.

Product quality and price. Analyzing competitors in a specific market involves evaluating the quality and price of their products. As the result of such an analysis, a new business might find that the competition offers products of medium quality at limited prices. This indicates that a need might exist for higher and lower quality products in various price ranges. Armed with this information, a new business has a better chance to provide products that customers want and need and to compete successfully in a specific market. Before locating in a community, a new business would consider the size and availability of space, and the cost of supplies and equipment. However, these are not factors involved in analyzing competitors. Industry research might be useful, but the training that the industry provides is not a factor in analyzing the competition.

The shorter the forecast, the more accurate the prediction. Forecasts that project sales beyond one year are less accurate than short-term forecasts due to unpredictable changes that can occur over a longer period of time. Market conditions can vary at any time; therefore, businesses cannot be assured that conditions will remain the same for a year. Longitudinal studies are research efforts that measure certain factors repeatedly over a long period of time. Forecasting methods can be appropriate for periods longer than one year depending on the objectives of the forecast, the business's resources, the purpose(s) of the forecast, and the conditions of the market.

$47,015. The objectives in a marketing plan are usually intended to lead to an increase in sales. When preparing its marketing plan, a business often establishes the amount it will spend on promotional activities in order to achieve a specific objective. Many businesses base the amount spent on promotion on the amount of sales. If the goal is to increase sales by increasing promotion, the business usually will allocate more money for the promotional budget. To determine how much more a business will spend by increasing the promotional budget, first calculate the existing budget by multiplying current sales by the percentage spent on promotion ($2,350,750 x 7% or .07 = $164,552.50). Then, calculate the amount if the percentage spent on promotion is increased ($2,350,750 x 9% or .09 = $211,567.50). Next, subtract the current amount from the proposed amount to determine the increase ($211,567.50 - $164,552.50 = $47,015).

Take corrective action. After a business develops and implements a marketing plan, it needs to know whether the plan was effective in achieving its marketing objectives. Therefore, a business evaluates the performance of its marketing plan to identify problems and take corrective action to solve the problems. If the plan is not performing as expected, a business needs to find out why and then make changes. Perhaps the objectives were unrealistic or the strategies were not clear. Whatever the reasons, the problems need to be corrected for the business to be able to succeed. Scheduling is not an evaluation function. Businesses usually gather accounting data and analyze market price before they develop a marketing plan.

Financial reports. Businesses are required to provide a variety of financial reports to many groups of people, such as governments for tax purposes and creditors for lending purposes. Therefore, businesses maintain accounting information that they use to prepare these financial reports. Depending on the size of the business, the accounting information may be simple or complex. Businesses do not use accounting information to prepare operating procedures, inventory controls, or pricing systems.

Quality culture. Businesses need to train accounting department employees so they will understand their jobs and have the ability to work with customers. Employees who know what they are expected to do and how to do it usually create a sense of quality in a business. They are able to function effectively and provide quality service to customers. In return, customers appreciate the quality and continue to buy from the business. Training employees does not necessarily create a secure environment, a friendly atmosphere, or a growth opportunity.

Invest elsewhere. Corporations are owned by their stockholders. These businesses are expected to earn money for their owners and to pay them regular dividends on their investments. If a business does not make enough profit to do this, investors are likely to sell their stock and to invest in another company. If a corporation was unable to pay dividends, it is unlikely that stockholders would buy additional shares. Stockholders do not reduce earnings or organize takeovers.

Job shadowing. To obtain information about specific occupations and careers, it is sometimes possible to follow an employee who performs a certain job. This is an example of job shadowing and gives an individual the opportunity to find out exactly what a certain job involves. An individual might follow an accounting department employee for a few days, watch what the employee does, listen to conversations with coworkers, and possibly help with simple tasks. Volunteering involves donating time to complete a project. An internship is training in which schools and businesses cooperate to provide on-the-job practice for learners. Although an individual shadowing an employee might ask questions, following an employee is not an example of interviewing.

The price must satisfy both buyers and sellers. Buyers want low prices, and sellers want high prices. Both groups must feel that they are getting the most value from the product in order for customers to be satisfied and the business to be successful. Customers associate price with quality. If a price is lower than a customer expects to pay, the customer may not buy. Businesses must be willing to adjust their prices according to circumstances. Selling price includes the cost of the product and all of its associated costs, such as transportation charges and promotion expenses.

Pricing. The technology that makes possible pre-printing product packaging with Universal Product Codes (UPCs) simplifies the price marking function. The UPC label is encoded with product information, such as price, to be read by an electronic scanner. The pre-printed data simplify the price marking function because the business does not need to mark a price on each product. The UPC label contains the necessary pricing information. Pre-printed UPC labels do not contain tracking, operating, or selling information.

Marketing strategies. After being introduced on the market, all products move through the life-cycle stages at different rates, requiring different marketing strategies. These stages of the life cycle become the basis for product planning. Marketers must understand how and why competition will change from one stage of the product life cycle to another in order to plan marketing strategies that will be most effective for the product at each stage of its life cycle. Some product characteristics may be modified as a product moves through its life cycle; however, most product characteristics are set during development. Marketers are not free to pick and choose which government regulations they use. A marketing-information management system is an organized way of continually gathering, accessing, synthesizing, evaluating, and disseminating information for use in making business decisions.

Ethical. When a business exhibits ethical behavior, it is being socially responsible because it is considering society's well-being.

A business that preserves the environment's natural resources is not necessarily exhibiting logical, authentic, or conservative attitudes or beliefs.

Trends. A product opportunity is a situation in which a business acts on the chance to provide a good or service to a market segment that wants and is willing to pay for the product. One way that a business recognizes product opportunities is to monitor trends by using a systematic or step-by-step process. A trend is the general direction in which people or events are moving. A business often monitors many types of trends including demographic, psychographic, and economic trends. Once a business identifies a trend, it can develop products to satisfy the needs of a particular market. Monitoring personnel, finances, and plans does not generally help a business to recognize product opportunities.

Increased profits. Companies that build a reputation for carrying out the terms of their warranties and guarantees generally have higher sales, more repeat customers, and greater profits.

Legal recourse means that customers are entitled to file a lawsuit against a company which does not fulfill its obligation under a warranty or a guarantee. Free repairs are offered customers during a specified time period at no cost to them. Customers' anxiety about purchases are reduced because they know any problem connected with the purchase will be taken care of by the seller.

Brand positioning refers to marketers creating a certain image or impression of a brand as compared to those of competitors' brands. Descriptive names are brand names which have fallen into everyday use so that the brand is used to describe every product in the brand's product category.

Attributes. Positioning is a product mix strategy that a business uses to create a certain image or impression of a product in the minds of the consumers. An attribute is a characteristic of something. Businesses often position products by emphasizing attributes such as materials, features, and construction methods in relation to the product's safety. For example, an automobile manufacturer that places side airbags in all of its models might use this safety feature to position its line of vehicles as safe and reliable modes of transportation. Price is a positioning strategy that stresses the amount of money the customer pays for a product. Class is a positioning strategy that often associates status with the product. The competition positioning strategy compares a product with other similar products in the marketplace.

Drop a product. Businesses consider many factors when planning the type of merchandise to stock or keep on the shelves. If a particular product is costly to purchase and promote as well as difficult to sell, a business might decide to drop the product. In this situation, the business might have too high of an investment in a product that does not turn over fast enough to generate a sufficient profit. The answer to the problem is to drop the product. Businesses do not increase inventory or add shelf space for products that have a low turnover rate. The business would not eliminate personnel.

Stereotypes. A stereotype is a set image or an assumption about a person or thing. An advertisement that portrays a woman in a traditional female role (e.g., mopping the kitchen floor) is reinforcing a stereotype. Stereotyping women in such roles may offend some people because many males and females now share the responsibility of household chores. Discrimination is the unfair treatment of a person or group based on the person's or group's characteristics. Some people consider an advertisement that portrays a woman in a traditional female role as a gender-based form of discrimination rather than age-based discrimination. Socialization refers to the way in which a community organizes itself. Equity label is a fictitious term.

Comparison advertising. A comparison advertisement is a promotional message in which the advertiser pays for a message that compares its product to another company's similar product. The advertiser's intent is to focus on the positive attributes of its product while pointing out negative aspects of its competitor's product. Sometimes, advertisers make false or deceptive statements about the competitors' products, which can negatively impact the competitors' businesses. To help maintain a fair competitive environment, governments often regulate the way businesses can use comparisons in their advertising efforts. Bait-and-switch refers to an advertising tactic that businesses use that includes promoting a low-priced item to attract customers and then trying to sell a higher priced item to them. However, bait-and-switch contests do not exist. Direct mail and telemarketing sales are not specific promotional activities that governments regulate for the primary purpose of maintaining a fair competitive environment for businesses.

A testimonial is a statement by an identified user of a product, proclaiming the benefits received from the use of the product.

Objections. An objection is a point of difference between a customer and a salesperson that may prevent a sale, or the customer's reason for not buying. A salesperson who stays up to date on the information provided in company promotional materials usually is able to effectively handle customers' objections and often make the sale. The promotional materials provide the salesperson with selling information that often helps to overcome customers' objections. Assumptions are taking something for granted. Compliments are something said in admiration or praise. Suggestions are ideas.
