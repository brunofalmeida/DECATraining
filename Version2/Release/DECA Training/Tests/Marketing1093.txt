Case. Case law is a primary source of law that is based on previous court decisions. Constitutional law is
the supreme law of the land and is based upon the U.S. Constitution. Uniform laws address issues such as
trade and commerce. Uniform laws provide legal consistency among the states that adopt them. The U.S.
Congress enacts statutory laws.

Breached the duty of care. The duty of care is the basic principle that expects all individuals and
businesses to exhibit socially responsible behavior by using caution to prevent harm and by watching out
for one another. A tort is a private wrongdoing that potentially harms another person or entity. If a
business or one of its employees breaches the duty of care, the business may be held liable for the tort.
However, the plaintiff must have grounds or proof that establishes that the business or its employee
(defendant) has committed a wrongful act, thereby breaching the duty of care. Intentional damage and
conspiring with a competitor (collusion) are types of torts. The doctrine of sovereign immunity is the
universally accepted principle that each nation has the right to manage its own government and develop
its own laws.

A large piece of farm machinery. Exclusive distribution means selling a product through just one
middleman in a geographic area. Marketers use this method when they need to maintain tight control
over a product. This is why exclusive distribution is often used for specialty products that are technical in
nature or require specialized services such as installation or repair. Examples of these products are
airplanes and large machinery. Milk and magazines are examples of convenience products, which
usually use intensive distribution patterns. A silk necktie is an example of a consumer shopping good,
which usually uses a selective distribution pattern.

Agents. These are businesses or individuals that assist in the sale and/or promotion of goods and
services but do not take title to them. Wholesalers are businesses that buy goods from producers or
agents and sell to retailers. Retailers are businesses that buy consumer goods and services and sell
them to ultimate consumers. Industrial users are businesses that buy materials or goods that will be used
to make other goods and services or in the operation of the business.

Refusing to sell to uncooperative retailers. This type of action may be considered a violation of antitrust
acts. Meeting or surpassing customer expectations establishes brand loyalty and encourages retailers to
carry the brand with fewer demands on the manufacturer. Customizing the distribution channel of key
retail customers also reduces these demands by individualizing to meet these same retailers' specific
needs. Establishing their own distribution strategies around smaller stores and eliminating the demands
of the larger retail chains can also give manufacturers more control in distribution channels.

Making sure products are in stock before advertising a sale. It is important for businesses to coordinate
distribution with the marketing function of promotion because products must be in stock and available to
sell when they are advertised. Businesses that are planning to advertise a sale must first make sure the
products are in stock. If customers visit a business to buy products that are not available, they may
become irritated with the business and go elsewhere to buy. Promotion includes writing a news release
to announce a new product line and organizing a contest to attract customers to the business. However,
these activities do not involve distribution. Placing an advance order to obtain a seasonal discount is a
distribution function, but it does not involve promotion.

7. D
A restaurant franchisee uses unauthorized food suppliers that compromise brand integrity. Horizontal
conflict is defined as disagreement among channel members that perform distribution activities at the
same level. For example, restaurant franchisees must follow the rules that the parent company
(franchisor) establishes in the franchise agreement. Using unauthorized suppliers is not only a breach of
contract, but is compromising brand integrity by using products that the franchisor might consider below
standard. This can create conflict among other franchisees who are following the rules. Direct distribution
is the channel of distribution in which goods and services move directly from the producer to the
consumer or industrial user. Since the manufacturer is a new company, it is not creating conflict by
engaging in direct distribution since it has not established a dealership arrangement. A manufacturer that
provides authorized dealers with rebate programs does not necessarily create conflict among its dealers.
Soliciting bids and awarding contracts are common business practices and can create normal economic
competition.

New personnel regulations. Most businesses prepare a variety of internal reports that are intended to
inform employees about changes in policies and procedures. These internal reports often explain new
personnel regulations. If employees analyze the reports, they will be able to understand and comply with
the new personnel policies and procedures. Businesses do not share customer profiles with all
employees. Internal business reports concerning policies and procedures usually do not explain industry
research data or list former local competitors.

Maintaining eye contact. By maintaining eye contact, listeners are communicating to a speaker that they
are paying attention. This supports and encourages a speaker because the listeners are indicating that
they are focused on the message. If listeners do not maintain eye contact, a speaker might think that the
listeners do not care about the message and stop talking. When listeners look around the room, close
their eyes, or glance at the clock, they are telling the speaker that they are bored or not interested.

apologize for not knowing and offer to get the information. No one is expected to know everything, but
you should know where to find necessary information. Always offer to call the customer back. It may be
inconvenient for the customer to call you again, and s/he should not be asked to call someone else.
Asking the customer why s/he needs the information would be rude.

Quantitative primary data are costly to obtain. The writing process typically involves several steps: prewriting,
drafting, revising, editing, and publishing. During the editing step, the writer or copyreader should
review what has been written to determine if it meets certain criteria to be published and/or shared with
others. These criteria include proper sentence structure, appropriate grammar and punctuation, correct
spelling, etc. “Quantitative primary data are costly to obtain” is the only statement that is properly
structured, contains appropriate grammar and punctuation, and is spelled correctly. (The word “data” is
the plural of “datum”.) The word “quota” is singular, so “Roger's weekly sales-volume quota are $8,500”
contains an incorrect verb. (The verb should be “is,” not “are”.) In the statement “Carole is developing a
prodect analysis sheet”, the word “prodect” is spelled incorrectly. (The correct spelling is “product”.) The
phrase “Frank, Gus, and Bob” is a plural subject, so the wrong verb is used in the predicate of the
sentence. (The verb should be “are” instead of “is”.)

To provide external sources with accurate financial information. The accounting function collects and
records the financial information in the appropriate format. Governments require businesses to provide
certain types of financial information to regulatory agencies and shareholders in specific ways. For
example, some governments require large businesses to use a specific accounting method, such as the
accrual method. The accrual accounting method records transactions at the time they occur even if no
money changes hands at that time. An advantage of using the accrual method is that it provides
investors, creditors, and customers with a more accurate picture of a business's cash flow over time.
Governments do not require businesses to use a specific accounting method to ensure that they are
complying with intellectual property laws, to control the ways in which businesses develop credit policies,
or to monitor how businesses establish sales goals and budgets.

tell research participants how their information will be used and give them the opportunity to indicate that
they do not want it to be sold to others. Ethical marketers explain research procedures in detail, identify
the sponsor of the research project, and ensure the anonymity of all participants.

habits on an ongoing basis. The business can use the data to determine its fast-moving items and its
customers' brand preferences. Comment cards are small, short, preprinted questionnaires. Manual

Leadership. For a project manager, one of the most important skills is the ability to guide or direct the
actions of others in a desired manner. One of the project manager's main roles is to lead the group to
achieve the project's goal. Managers who have good leadership skills are able to motivate group
members and persuade members to follow their directions. Project managers also need to have decisionmaking
skills and communication skills. However, leadership skills enable managers to guide or direct the
actions of others. The group usually sets the goals of the project, although the manager guides the
discussion.

Dividing the country into districts. Some businesses have grown so large that central buying can no
longer effectively purchase for geographically distant locations. In response to this development, many
large businesses have decentralized their purchasing operations. This has been accomplished by
dividing the country into districts and delegating part of central buying's responsibility to district managers
who are more familiar with local businesses. Businesses do not decentralize purchasing operations by
organizing departments into one, warehousing items until needed, or requisitioning sufficient quantities.

type of resource is natural resources, which includes the materials from which to make products. Without
the necessary raw materials and natural resources, businesses would be unable to produce goods and

Receive a promotion. When an employee receives a promotion, s/he is usually given more responsibility

who receive promotions often share common traits and patterns of behavior. These employees tend to
be dependable—they follow through on their promises and complete their work on time. Employees who
receive promotions are also willing to learn new skills, such mastering a new computer program.
Employees who receive promotions also take initiative. Initiative is the willingness to do something or
perform a task without being told to do so, rather than taking a passive approach to work. Many types of

Lowering prices during bad economic times. Businesses understand that they often need to be flexible
and adjust prices based on a variety of factors. One of these factors is the condition of the economy. For
example, during bad economic times, customers are quite cautious about how they spend their money.
To attract these customers, businesses may need to lower their prices. On the other hand, businesses
may increase prices when economic conditions are good because customers may be willing to spend
more. Charging the same price all the time is not an example of being flexible. Setting prices based on
the quality of products is an example of realistic pricing. Offering money-off coupons is a promotional
technique.

Unethical. Setting very low prices on products to try to drive competitors out of business is an example of
predatory pricing. In most cases, this type of pricing is considered unethical because its only purpose is
to eliminate competition. Once businesses have driven out competitors, they usually raise prices because
customers now have nowhere else to buy those products. This type of pricing often is effective in
attracting customers; however, it is unethical because it eliminates competition. This type of pricing is not
misleading or deceptive because it clearly advertises a very low price.

Idea generation. New products begin with ideas. Idea generation is the process of thinking up or creating
new plans and schemes and is often used in creating new products and modifying existing products.
Many companies solicit new ideas on a continuous basis as part of the product/service management
program. Business analysis is examining such factors as demand, costs, competition, capital investment
required, and potential profit of a good or service to determine how it will fit into the company's product
mix. Test marketing is the process of introducing a new product to a limited market to determine what its
acceptance will be. Concept testing is exploring the concept, or idea, for a product in order to obtain
feedback.

Demographic changes. A product opportunity is a favorable circumstance that presents itself to provide a
good or service that people are willing to buy. Individuals often discover product opportunities by simply
being aware of changes that are occurring around them. Demographics are the physical and social
characteristics of the population. Age is a demographic characteristic of the population or market
segment. As a segment of the population ages, its wants and needs change. When an individual
recognizes physical and social changes, s/he has identified a product opportunity due to demographic
shifts. Personal attitudes are psychographic factors. Psychographics are a market segment's shared
attitudes, opinions, and values. Geographic limitations relate to a specific location or region such as
hilliness or a lack of water. Economic resources are the human and natural resources and capital goods
used to produce goods and services.

Encourage long-term use. Product bundling is the practice of putting together a number of

customer less than if s/he purchased each product separately. Product bundling is often a method that a
business uses to get customers to try a product that they normally would not purchase. The hope is that
once the customers use the product, they will like it and continue to purchase it, thereby encouraging
long-term use. Increasing sales quotas, controlling expenses, and obtaining referrals are not primary
reasons for bundling products.

Promotional messages that portray men or women in certain roles do not always reinforce brand

cultural background. Demographic data is information that a business gathers about segments of the
population. The business collects demographic data before it develops the promotional message for its

Increased sales. Word-of-mouth communication is promotion and publicity for a business provided by
customers who tell others of their satisfaction with the business. This type of positive communication
often leads to increased sales for the business because it attracts new customers. When satisfied
customers tell others about their positive experiences, they are encouraging others to buy from the
business. This will not decrease advertising costs because the business still needs to advertise.
Advertising is an operating expense. Word-of-mouth communication does not increase the product mix,
which is the particular assortment of goods and services that a business offers in order to meet the needs

Media kit. The public-relations function involves establishing good relationships between the business
and the public. A business tries to maintain positive relationships with different groups that make up the
public, such as employees, shareholders, local businesses, government officials, and the media. It is
important for a business to build positive relationships with the media because they have access to large
groups of people through the airwaves and their publications. Often, a business provides newspaper and
magazine publishers and television and radio stations with media kits that provide information about the
business and its employees. It is the business's goal that the media will air or publish news stories that
portray the business in a favorable way, which provides positive publicity. The public-relations director did
not develop a sponsorship program, creative brief, or advertising profile.

Damage control. In some cases, businesses use public-relations activities to counter negative publicity or
to respond to negative information. This is an example of controlling the damage that may have been
caused by a specific incident. For example, if the media reports that a product has been tampered with
and resulted in injury to some customers, a business would use public-relations activities to reassure the
public that every attempt was being made to keep the product safe. This helps to control the negative
information and maintain good relations with the public. Product research, market segmentation, and
sales management are not functions of public-relations activities.

feelings. One emotional motivator is fear, which influences customers to buy certain products to be safe
and protected against injury. An example is buying a certain vehicle because it is equipped with various
types of safety devices. Emotion is a strong motivator, and one that salespeople appeal to in order to sell
products. Rational motives are reasons for buying that appeal to the sense of reason or judgment. Logic
is an objective, or neutral, way to make sense of the facts by considering some facts more important than
others. Patronage motives are reasons for buying that are based on loyalty to a particular business.
