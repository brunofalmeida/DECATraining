Tort law. The concept of wrongful action is the basis of all torts. Tort law that applies to business involves
the wrongful interference with the right of a business to operate. Therefore, business torts are wrongful
actions against a business that cause it harm in some way. An example might be unfair competition. The
wrongful interference with the right of a business to operate is not the basis of business liability, fraud, or
compliance.

Producer. The channel of distribution begins with the producer. The producer's goal is to reach the
consumer as quickly and efficiently as possible. A retailer buys consumer goods or services and sells
them to the ultimate consumer. A wholesaler buys goods from producers or agents and sells them to
retailers. An agent assists in the sale and/or promotion of goods and services, but does not take title to
them. The retailer, wholesaler, and agent are intermediaries because they operate between the producer
and consumer to help the movement of goods and services.

Gray market. The gray market involves buying goods from suppliers that are not the authorized
distributors for the manufacturers. This practice is considered unethical and even illegal because the
suppliers do not have the right to sell the goods. Businesses often are able to buy goods for lower prices
on the gray market, which enables them to sell the goods for less. Exporting is the process of selling
goods and services to businesses in other countries. Outlet stores usually sell overruns and irregular
products. Discount stores sell regular merchandise at lower prices than those found in department stores.

Making an appeal for action. If a speaker is trying to get an audience to do something, challenging them

Makes the product appealing. Persuasive messages usually are intended to encourage someone to do
something. In the case of a sales message, the goal usually is to persuade a customer to buy a product.
In order to do this, the message should make the product appealing to the customer so the customer will
understand the benefit of buying and want to buy. The sales message should persuade the customer to
spend money. Persuasive sales messages are not intended to simply remind the customer of the product
or discredit the competition. Persuasive messages should not use loaded language, which is often biased
and stereotypical.

people within a business. Memorandums often are distributed to employees within a business to update
them on the progress of various projects, or inform them of changes in policies and procedures. They are
informal and simple because they are intended only for the use of the business's employees. A proposal
usually is a complex written report that is formal and may be distributed to those outside the business.
Handbooks and newsletters are internal company publications but they are not memorandums.

complicated than they could handle. Employees would not give customers a booklet to read because
most businesses do not have all of their policies in written form.

or a site where a want or need (e.g., reservation) is fulfilled. An Internet web site fulfills a customer's
desire to make a hotel reservation. Promotion is the marketing element referring to the various types of
communications that marketers use to inform, persuade, or remind customers of their products. Product
is defined as goods and services that businesses offer their customers. Possession refers to the goods

Economics. Economics is the study of how limited resources are used to satisfy unlimited, competing
wants for goods and services. The gap between unlimited wants and limited resources creates a
condition known as scarcity. Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing,
promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and
organizational objectives. Purchasing involves the planning and procedures necessary to obtain goods
and services for use in the operation of a business or for resale. Manufacturing is the process of
changing raw materials into finished products.

way to communicate because the employee does not have a fair chance to complete an assignment
successfully. Managers have an obligation to treat all employees ethically and give them the information
and tools needed to do the job. It is ethical for managers to explain that some information is confidential
and to limit the distribution of classified information. Sending information in simple chart form often makes
it easier for employees to understand complex data.

Level of stress. Employees who set realistic goals and standards for themselves rather than expecting
perfection all the time are usually able to control and manage their level of stress. It is important for
employees to understand that they cannot perform perfectly in all situations and that they will make some
mistakes. Being aware of this helps employees to manage stress because they will not set their goals so
high that they will often be unable to achieve them. Striving to obtain perfection all the time increases
stress and may cause employees to think that they are failures if they don't live up to those expectations.
Employees usually advance based on their ability to perform satisfactorily on the job. Managers usually
establish work schedules and expect employees to work in groups when necessary.

Risk is high. Insurance is a contractual agreement in which one company (insurer) will pay for specified
losses incurred by the other company (insured) in return for installment payments (premium). The
premium amount is dependent on many factors, including the risk, or chance of loss. For example, a
business located near a river that frequently floods is more likely to pay higher property insurance
premiums than a business that is not located near a body of water. The insurance company is more likely
to pay a claim to the business for flood damages because the chance for flooding is higher. To cover the
claim, the insurance company will charge the business high premiums for the policy. Low liability, minimal
threats, and good security tend to lower premiums.

To offer products that customers want. Businesses are likely to fail if they do not offer products that
customers want. Because customers' needs and wants change over time, hospitality and tourism
businesses must collect and monitor marketing information. Knowing what customers want helps
businesses develop or adapt products that suit their customers' changing wants and needs. Although
hospitality and tourism businesses use technology to acquire marketing information, using technology is
not the primary reason for obtaining the marketing information. Businesses can improve their
relationships with their creditors by paying their bills. Marketing information can help hospitality and
tourism businesses make sound business decisions to increase market share; however, their primary
reason for doing so should not be to drive indirect competitors out of business, which may be illegal.

interviewer influence or bias. A disadvantage to using Internet surveys is that poorly written questions
may be confusing for respondents, which may lead them to answer questions incorrectly because they
have no way to obtain clarification. Another disadvantage is that many Internet surveys involve
respondent anonymity, so follow up is difficult unless the marketer has the respondent's e-mail address.

this situation occurs, businesses often reduce expenses in an attempt to stay in business until the rate of
employment starts to rise again. Increased regulation is a political factor. Population shift is a
demographic factor. Lifestyle adjustment is a cultural factor.

Accounts payable. Accounts payable refers to all monies owed by the business to others. Many
companies have departments that handle all of the bills (accounts payable) that the companies need to
pay. When a project requires the input of several outside sources, there are usually many bills associated
with the project. To make sure that the projected budget amounts match the actual bills, the project
manager may request copies of the invoices from the accounts payable department to review the
invoices for discrepancies. The sales, inventory control, and service departments do not handle accounts
payable.

Continual inspection program. Many businesses develop continual inspection programs in order to
identify and correct any problems. Businesses often have programs that call for the inspection of each
area on a regular basis. For example, the lights may be checked weekly while the heating and cooling
system is inspected twice a year. By continually inspecting equipment and facilities, a business is able to
prevent many breakdowns from occurring. Continual inspection may identify problems with
housekeeping, landscaping, and security that the business would then be able to correct.

So they do not put themselves or others in additional danger. The most important thing to do is to try to
stay calm and not do anything that might anger the robber. By angering the robber, the event may
escalate into a situation where someone gets hurt. For example, attempting to write down the description
of the robber, refusing to cooperate or follow instructions, or attempting to distract or overtake the robber
while the robbery is in process might anger the robber and result in serious injury. When the robber
leaves the premises, the police should be called and a physical description of the robber should be
detailed in a written format. Many businesses have hidden or quiet alarm systems located on the
premises. Employees should be carefully trained to use the silent alarm system in the event of a robbery.

Electronic key cards. These offer excellent security for hotel guests as they do not contain a hotel room
number, so that if one is lost or stolen it cannot be easily traced. Metal detectors are used in airports to
check passengers entering boarding areas. Retailers use radio frequency identification tags, which are
attached to expensive merchandise, to reduce the risk of shoplifting. A property management system is
used to store information about reservations, room availability, and room rates.

Sitting up straight. Individuals are frequently judged by others on the basis of first impressions or the

dressy clothes at all times is inappropriate and may indicate poor judgment. Not letting the other person
talk makes a bad impression.

concerts), and lodging (e.g., hotel, motel, bed and breakfast inn). Destination planning and transportation
(e.g., airlines, bus tours) are functions of the travel and tourism industry. Financial services, such as

One night at an all-inclusive resort. Price in the hospitality industry is the amount that guests pay for the
primary services provided by a property. In most situations, the price is the amount guests pay for one
night's lodging. However, in the case of an all-inclusive resort, price is the amount a guest pays for one
night's lodging which also includes a variety of extras such as meals and beverages. An all-inclusive
price is often appealing to guests because they think they are getting a bargain. Price in the hospitality
industry usually does not include dinner in the main dining room, transportation, or sightseeing trips.
These services are often included in a total vacation package that is often provided by the travel and
tourism industry.

Reinforce a business's image. Core values represent the underlying worth of products and the image
those products project. The image of products reinforces a business's image. Ideally, the core values of
the business and its products should be the same or compatible. For example, exhibiting social
responsibility is a core value. Businesses project this value in their products by making products that are
safe. Communicating the core value of product safety also reinforces the business's image of being
socially responsible. Communicating the core values of products is not an effective way to explain the
price structure, analyze the sales operation, or create a distribution channel.

Shuttle. Shuttle services provide a means of transportation for guests and their baggage when the
property is located far away from popular destinations such as the airport. Valet services are responsible
for cleaning guests' garments so that guests don't have to obtain access to laundry facilities. Concierge
services provide tourist information, directions, dinner reservations, and other personalized services that
make it easier for guests to enjoy their stay and to navigate unfamiliar territory. Bell staff services handle
guests' baggage, making it easier for them to get to and from their room, as well as their modes of

Extension. A hospitality business might add an item (e.g., suite hotels) to its existing product line to
appeal to a broader audience. A traditional hotel business might add suite hotels to its product line to
attract guests who have large families and need more room, or to appeal to travelers who are staying
longer than the typical transient guests. Acquiring assistance from outside organizations or consultants to
obtain goods or services to accomplish business objectives is known as outsourcing. A product feature
is a fact or characteristic of a specific product. Enhancement can be described as a product
improvement. Outsource, feature, and enhancement are not terms commonly used to describe the
addition of a product to an existing product line in the hospitality industry.

communication. Users are able to click on the ad and be linked to the advertiser's home page. Users also
may click on a portion of the ad to obtain additional information, download coupons or other specials, or
link to related sites. The banner advertisements interact with users by providing information and allowing
users to respond to the information by linking to other information or sites. Banner advertisements are not
restrictive or selective because they are available to all users who access the site on which they appear.
The advertisements may, or may not, be productive depending on whether they appeal to consumers.

Hyperlinks. A hyperlink is a component of an electronic document that can be clicked on to jump to

possible to link from somewhere within the e-mail to a web site. Hyperlinks are a great way to drive traffic
to web sites. An address book is a list of Internet addresses. A gateway is a combination of hardware and
software that connects different types of networks that convert an e-mail so that the software program
understands it. A mailing list is a system that sends out regular e-mail messages to subscribers of the list.

Primary colors. Colors generally should be bright rather than pastel, and an artist should keep the color
scheme simple. When the color scheme is simple, the main illustration helps to make the basic idea of
the billboard stand out. Excessive variations of tones and tints should be avoided. It is best to use
primary colors only—the most readable combination is black on yellow. If too many colors are used, the
billboard may confuse and distract the viewer.

Script. Script type styles are those in which the letters are linked together and look like cursive
handwriting. Script styles are most often used when messages are formal or want to convey high quality.
Because script type styles look like handwriting, they often convey a more personal touch to a message.
Novelty type styles are decorative in nature and are used primarily as headlines. Sans serif type styles do
not have feet or strokes at the end of the letter forms. Roman type styles use a combination of thin and
thick lines and are often used for lengthier copy or text.

Red, yellow, and orange. Color harmonies are the ways in which colors are combined on the page to
create a sense of visual order and appeal. Colors tend to trigger certain feelings in people. Because the
color red attracts the most attention visually, it tends to generate intense emotion and energy. Yellow also
attracts attention and tends to be an “optimistic” color. Because yellow is hard on the eyes, it should be
used sparingly. Orange is a mixture of red and yellow and often generates feelings of enthusiasm and
warmth. Blue and purple are cool colors that create a sense of calm and tranquility. Green is easiest on
the eye and is most often associated with nature. White signifies purity, and black signifies authority.

Indicate a benefit. After the graphic, the headline is the next element of an advertisement the audience
scans. A well-written headline is short and memorable, and it encourages the audience to read the
advertising copy. An effective headline also indicates how the product will benefit the reader. For
example, a Tide laundry detergent advertisement contained a headline stating, ”Just when you thought
laundry couldn't get any more fun.” The benefit of using Tide is having fun while doing laundry. The
headline does not need to criticize the competition or offer a guarantee to be effective.

Keep it short. Because mobile advertisements are displayed on cell phones, it is important to keep the
message short and direct. If the message is too long, the intended audience is likely to delete the ad
without reading it. The use of symbols (e.g., an offer 4 u) in mobile ad copy depends on characteristics of
the target audience. For example, tech-savvy 16- to 25-year-olds are more likely to understand the use of
symbols than those who do not “text” or use technology on a regular basis. Coupons are a salespromotion
technique.

Make sure the firm's name is correct. All kinds of mistakes are possible in print ads. The firm paying for

telephone number and hours of business operation with the business identification, and this information
should be checked for accuracy. Questions as to how long an ad will run, what media will present it, and
how it compares with competitors' ads would be answered before a final proof of the ad is prepared.

Use pauses between questions. Pausing is an effective technique that enables the customer to absorb all

are inappropriate. When stock is limited, fewer questions are needed to narrow the choices for the

needs better than the item originally requested. After recommending a substitute product, a salesperson

To address their needs. Before salespeople can decide which selling technique to use to sell goods or
services to customers, they need to find out something about the customers. Each customer has a
different need and responds differently to various selling techniques. Effective salespeople obtain
information about customers in order to determine their needs and to use the most appropriate selling
technique to satisfy those needs. Salespeople often make conversation and ask for information in an
attempt to find out something about their customers. Salespeople usually do not expect to develop
personal relationships with their customers.

Recommendations of friends. People often rely heavily on the recommendations of friends, relatives, and

assume that they and their friends have similar likes and dislikes and would enjoy the same travel
destinations. People usually do not select a destination if their friends had a bad experience and do not
recommend it. People are not motivated to choose travel destinations because of the methods of
promotion, actions of competitors, or level of maintenance.

Executive management. Executive, or top-level, management is composed of all managers who are
responsible for the entire company. They must chart the course and provide leadership in order for the
business to be successful. Middle management is composed of managers who report to top-level
management and who have supervisors who report to them. Supervisory, or first-level, management
works directly with employees who carry out the business's routine work.
