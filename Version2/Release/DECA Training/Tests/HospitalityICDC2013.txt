owner's authorization or permission for another entity to use trademarked, copyrighted, or patented
material for a specific activity, during a specific time period, for the profit of both parties. The licensor is
the owner of the material, and the licensee is the buyer.

The SkyHigh Airline. When David checked his luggage with the SkyHigh airline attendant before boarding
the airplane, the airline accepted responsibility for the safety of his belongings. Therefore, the airline is
liable for David's loss. Typically, passengers must file claims with the airlines to obtain compensation for
their losses. Under most circumstances, employers (SkyHigh Airline) are responsible for their employees'
actions, and by law, are liable for their on-the-job conduct. In addition, there is not enough information
provided to determine if the attendant was actually responsible for the loss. The airports are not liable for
the airlines' losses.

A large resort with seven restaurants. A large resort with multiple restaurants is likely to use many
suppliers. A hospitality business that purchases high volumes of goods and services from several
suppliers may increase its efficiency by using an electronic data interchange (EDI) system. An EDI
system automatically transmits the business's sales information to its suppliers via computer, which
allows the suppliers to process the business's orders quickly. The EDI system helps reduce telephone
calls and paperwork and helps businesses manage their inventories efficiently. A small bed-andbreakfast
inn, a charter fishing boat operator, and an independent taxicab driver are less likely to
purchase high volumes of goods and services, so an EDI system is less likely to improve their efficiency
levels.

standards may not lead to cooperation among channel members in the distribution channel. Minimizing

Face-to-face. It's important to select the right communication channel when you have to deliver an
important message. For Pamela, the best choice is face-to-face communication. If she communicates in
person with Rob, he'll be able to hear her tone of voice, watch her facial expressions, and see her hand
gestures. He's less likely to interpret her words the wrong way, and even if he does, Pamela will be able
to clear up any misunderstandings immediately. While e-mail is a convenient communication channel
that's fast and efficient, it doesn't translate Pamela's nonverbal cues. Since tone can often be hard to
indicate in an e-mail, the chance that Rob will be upset is much higher. And if he is upset, Pamela will
have no way of knowing or fixing the problem, since she won't be in front of him when he receives her
message. A letter has many of the same problems as e-mail. Generally, a letter should be sent for
special occasions, not just for ordinary conversations about job performance. A phone call, while better
than an e-mail or letter, is still not ideal. Rob would be able to hear the tone of Pamela's voice, but he
would not see any gestures or facial expressions she may make. Also, Pamela wouldn't be able to
observe any of Rob's nonverbal cues, so she may not know if he's upset by their conversation.

One who complains because s/he gives the company an opportunity to fix its mistakes. Only a small
number of dissatisfied customers actually take the time to complain to a business. Instead, they typically
tell everyone they know about their bad experience, which can mean a lot of negative publicity for a
company that didn't even get a chance to correct the problem. When a customer complains, s/he gives a
business the opportunity to fix its mistakes. If a company handles the situation right, it can create a loyal
customer. A company should never attempt to tell a customer s/he is wrong, even if s/he is. Instead, the
person handling the complaint should listen and empathize with the customer. Fewer customer
complaints may save a company time and frustration in the short term, but in the long term they can end
up costing money. When customers complain about products or services, they alert a company to
possible problems. A company can then fix those problems early on and avoid expensive fixes down the
road. If a customer doesn't complain, it doesn't necessarily mean that s/he is satisfied. S/He may just not
tell the business that s/he is unsatisfied, which, as mentioned earlier, can actually be much worse than a
complaint.

Customer relationship. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) uses strategies, processes, and
policies to build, maintain, and maximize the long-term value of customer relationships. Goals of CRM
include developing a competitive advantage and increasing business profits. Business process
management is a business strategy that stresses technology, innovation, and flexibility to align an
organization's objectives and activities with customer needs. Human resource management is the
process of planning, staffing, leading, and organizing the employees of a business. First-line
management includes supervisors who work directly with the employees who carry out the business's

Capital goods can come in many forms, such as equipment, machinery, and tools. Delivery trucks are
capital goods because they enable producers to operate businesses and make products available to
consumers. Iron ore and weather conditions are both considered natural resources. A natural resource is
any resource that is found in nature and used to produce goods and services. Human resources are

Financial analysis. When a company experiences a change in human-resources management, it will also
experience a change in financial analysis. This is because the business activities are interrelated, and
one activity experiences a change, the other activities will change or adjust as well. For example, if a
company hires more employees (a part of human-resources management), it will have to adjust the
budget to be able to pay them (a part of financial analysis). A change in human-resources management
would not necessarily cause a change in profits, the business's name, or market share.

Pure and insurable. A pure risk is a risk with two possibilities—loss or no loss. This describes the loss
Dmitri faces from a hurricane. His business may be damaged, or it may not, but there's no chance he will

able to take out insurance policies against them. Speculative risks bring the possibility of loss, no change,
or gain. This category includes strategic and financial risks. Since these risks are unpredictable, they're
uninsurable.

High depth, high scope. Scope is the number of different operations you do on the job and the frequency
with which you do them. The lower your task level, the lower the scope. Putting doors on cars in an
assembly line, for example, is low scope, since you're performing one task over and over again. Because
Jamie is doing a variety of tasks, her job is high scope. Depth is the amount of control you have over the
tasks that you do. If your job has low depth, that means there are strict guidelines you must follow, and
you have very few decisions to make. Since Jamie is in charge of her project, she'll be making lots of
decisions. This means her job is high scope.

Sincere people are genuine in nature. Expressing empathy and sincerity helps build positive

based on a willingness to ignore the rights of others and to take advantage of them to achieve personal
goals.

Sympathy is the ability to recognize another person's feelings. If Molly simply felt sorry for her coworker's
situation, she would be sympathetic. However, Molly actually understands what it's like to be in her

Mutual fund. Mutual funds are a good investment for people who are concerned about risk. Stock mutual
funds are combinations of stocks from different corporations or agencies, usually from different
industries. The idea behind mutual funds is that they aren't as risky as buying individual stocks, but they
offer a good chance of receiving a return. The return Marco gets will depend on how much risk he's
willing to take. A savings account is a lending investment in which you lend money to a bank for the
benefit of being able to access your money at any time. Savings accounts are very low-risk, but they
don't make much money. With money market accounts, you're able to access some of your money each
month, but not all of it. There's a slightly higher interest rate than with a savings account. A bond is a
lending opportunity offered by a government, municipality, or corporation. Bonds are low-risk, but you
have to be willing to leave your money with the borrower for a long time (sometimes as much as 30
years!).

Budgets are not just for large businesses—they're also a necessity for the smallest business. Budgets

time-consuming. Interviewing happens after a list of potential candidates has been identified and the

after an employee has been hired and can include employee orientation and various types of paperwork,
like insurance, tax-withholding, direct deposit, and citizenship information. Orientation varies from

3.4 The mean is the average of the values within a sample. If the values range from 1 to 5, the mean is
the average of the respondents' ratings. To calculate mean, first multiply the number of respondents by
the value of their rating (11 X 1 = 11; 22 X 2 = 44; 68 X 3 = 204; 84 X 4 = 336; 15 X 5 = 75). Then, add
the values and divide by the number of respondents (11 + 44 + 204 + 336 + 75 = 670; 670 ÷ 200 = 3.35
or 3.4). In this example, 3.4 is the mean rating for the quality of the hotel restaurant's new summer salad
based on a scale of 1 to 5.

All of the items in a guestroom that need a housekeeper's attention. To aid in planning the housekeeping
department's work, the executive housekeeper prepares inventory lists of all the items that need
housekeeping's attention. The report should be prepared in the order in which housekeepers will clean
items and in which supervisors will inspect the rooms. The inventory lists are also used to develop
cleaning procedures, training plans, and inspection checklists. The executive housekeeper does not
manage the kitchen. Items go into inventory once they're received—not while they're expected. Items that
need to be fixed are identified on a maintenance report.

Emotional. Emotional motives are reasons for buying that appeal to customers' feelings. In Yvonne's

motives are reasons for buying that appeal to customers' senses of logic or judgment. For example, if
Yvonne's family went to a pizza place that has the lowest prices, that would be a rational motive. A
combination of both emotional and rational motives is typically what it takes to convince customers to
make a purchase. However, not everyone's the same—some people care more about rational motives,
while others care more about emotional motives. That's why it's so important for a company to get to
know its customers and figure out what they want. Experience and quality are not terms commonly used
to describe motives.

to be kept about six or seven years, while credit card statements only need to be retained for a year. It's

become out of date just as fast. For instance, most of today's computers cannot access data stored on a
floppy disc. Smart businesses “migrate” their older digital records to current technology whenever
possible. Digital records are actually easier to retrieve than paper records because you don't have to rifle
through file cabinets to find what you're looking for. Digital records are also less expensive to store than
paper records, since they don't require any physical space or filing cabinets. Digital records are reliable

It helps you determine your profit. If you don't pay attention to or maintain records, you'll have no idea

so you can determine your profit. Records help you keep track of sales, prices, and inventory, all of which

important for tax purposes—it's helpful with all aspects of business planning! Internal record maintenance
is important for all companies, whether they're big, small, new, or old. In fact, record maintenance can
help a small company identify opportunities and grow into a larger company. While it's important to keep

much shorter amount of time. For example, there's no need to keep every receipt forever.

The conversion process. During the conversion process, inputs turn into products. Any activity that takes
resources and turns them into something usable is considered a conversion process. In Filipe's case, this
includes cooking. He starts with resources (raw vegetables and meats) and turns them into something
usable (a fully-cooked meal). Dispatching involves issuing orders for production to start. Dispatches are
usually written orders that tell employees what their job assignments are, when to move materials from
storage to the work area, or which tools and equipment to assemble. Mass production means producing
products in large quantities. Mass production typically involves assembly lines, robotics, automation, and
computer-controlled equipment. This is not what Filipe's doing when he prepares one meal at a time.

Creating a quality assurance checklist. Proactive quality control involves stopping problems before they

control focuses on fixing problems after they've happened. This can include tasks such as filling out a
corrective action report, inspecting finished products, and processing customer returns. Reactive quality
control tends to cost more money and create more waste, since problems aren't discovered until after the

about sales transactions, businesses can review their invoices to analyze their customers' buying habits.
By reviewing invoices, a business can determine the best-selling products and the products that are not
moving, which helps the business make decisions about its product mix. Invoices do not reveal
information about customers' personal attitudes, annual incomes, or buying motives.

salary expectations, s/he will ask for them. Otherwise, giving a number that's either too high or too low
could take you out of the running. You shouldn't list your personal references on a resume because
employers usually only end up calling your references if you've advanced in the interview process. An

Inventory turnover rate. The inventory turnover rate (stockturn) is the number of times that stock is sold in
a given period of time. The turnover rates can reveal which items are popular and which items are not
selling well. If the items are moving slowly, the turnover rate will be low. If the item is inexpensive and has
sluggish sales, it might be outdated. This type of statistical data can help the business decide if it should
delete an item from its product line or not. Frequency is a quantitative measure of the average number of
times a target customer is exposed to an advertising message. The retention rate measures the

destination travelers and businesspeople who golf, while the original product markets to businesses and

sales from another of its products. Because the products attract different markets, it is unlikely that
cannibalization will occur after the golf resorts are up and running. The hotel chain is not restructuring its

Determine the concessions that it is willing to make. Businesses negotiate contracts with their vendors to
obtain the best prices, sales terms, and support. Effective negotiations require careful research and
planning before the negotiation session begins. An important planning consideration is for the business to
determine its optimal outcome and the concessions that it is willing to make to achieve agreement.
Concessions are terms that the business is willing to give up. For example, the business's optimal
quantity discount is 15%, but it is willing to give up 3% and settle for a 12% discount. Use of aggressive
tactics is more likely to hinder the ability to reach agreement. Summarizing the negotiation process
periodically and actively listening to the vendor's points of concern are actions taken during the
negotiation rather than before.

Using a font that looks like handwriting in the envelope's address section. Individuals and businesses
receive a lot of direct mail to their homes and offices. Many times, these special offers end up in the trash
can before they are opened. By adding personal touches, the direct-mail sender increases the chance
that the recipient will open and read the direct-mail offer. One technique many marketers use involves
printing the recipient's name and address directly on the envelope with a font that looks like handwriting.
This technique is especially effective when using an envelope that is the size of a greeting card. By doing
so, it appears that the offer is handwritten and personal. Addressing the recipient as “current resident” is
impersonal. Stamping “Open Now” on the envelope does not add a personal touch. The proper
placement of the return address is at the top left corner on the front of the envelope.

Connect with the target market. A blog is an online diary or journal. The primary purpose of a corporate

business-related topics that are likely to interest the audience. For example, a health-club blog might post
a video about treating strained muscles or post an article about the latest exercise trends. Blogs typically
have areas that allow readers to post comments about the topics at hand. The companies review the
readers' comments to learn about their target markets' opinions, needs, and wants, so they can
implement activities and develop products that appeal to their markets. Although companies often
provide product information and use entertaining techniques to attract readers, the primary purpose of
corporate blogs is not selling independent products, entertaining the audience, or replacing company web

A business sends a customer an online birthday greeting that includes a coupon for its products.
Recipients are more likely to open, read, and respond to personalized e-mail messages. Because
customers typically appreciate businesses that acknowledge important life events, businesses often send
personalized birthday and anniversary e-mail messages with promotional offers that appeal to the
customers' particular needs and wants. This tactic is one way that businesses can increase short-term
sales and build customer relationships in a cost effective way. Sending a general e-mail message to
customers, placing an online banner advertisement on a travel web site, and distributing the same
message to “preferred customers” are not personalized.

Unity. The basic principles of design are the guidelines for creating effective layouts for advertisements.
Unity involves making sure that all ad components—the headline, graphics, copy, etc.—relate to one
another effectively. Emphasis is the focal point of the advertisement. Balance is the design principle that
focuses on the size, weight, and position of the advertising elements. Contrast is the design principle that
uses elements of different sizes, shapes, textures, and tones.

Minimizes distractions. White space is blank space in a print advertisement that is unoccupied by text or
illustrations. Advertisers use white space as a design element to add balance to the ad layout. White
space minimizes distractions and clutter, which helps the reader to focus on the most important elements
of the advertisement. Using the right combination of words clarifies the copy or text. White space does
not add texture or reduce the need to include graphics in the advertisement.

Unplanned, planned. Word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing involves customers telling others—family, friends,
and coworkers—of their satisfaction with a particular business. Organic word-of-mouth marketing occurs
when satisfied customers voluntarily tell people around them about a business that they like. In this way,
the communication or promotion is unplanned because it occurs during normal conversation. On the
other hand, amplified word-of-mouth marketing takes place when marketers encourage their customers
to share information about a business with others. Because the marketers develop and implement
strategies to distribute information for their customers to share with others, this type of communication is
planned. Organic WOM is personal, spontaneous, and may either be vertically (e.g., employee to
supervisor) or horizontally (e.g., friend to friend) transmitted. Amplified WOM may or may not be
customized, free-flowing, or horizontal communication.

Mike Adams, an outgoing sales representative who plays a lot of golf and enjoys catching up with friends
on Facebook and Twitter. A customer evangelist is a very loyal product user who encourages others to
try the product. The customer evangelist actively seeks up-to-date information about the product, brand,
or business and passes that information on to his/her social network. Businesses use a variety of
strategies to provide their most loyal, outspoken supporters with information to pass on to others. Mike
Adams is more likely to be a successful customer evangelist because he plays a lot of golf and uses
social media to communicate with his friends and family. Ruth, Tommy, and Olivia have other interests

Click-to-call. This is a form of technology that converts web-based text into telephone connections. The
technology involves embedding a hyperlink into a web advertisement that potential customers receive to
their computers, smartphones, or tablets by e-mail or text message. When a person clicks on the
hyperlink, it automatically connects him/her to the business by telephone. The advantage to businesses

Press. A proof is the final opportunity for advertisers to review ads, correct mistakes, and approve the
ads. Correct color is very important to a company or organization that is placing print advertising. For
example, corporate logos may have a very specific color or color combination that identifies the
organization or product. Because a press proof uses the actual printing inks used to print the
advertisement, advertisers can see how the color will actually look on the printed piece. The
disadvantage of press proofs is that they are very expensive. Overlay proofs contain multiple colors, but
the colors are not very accurate. Bluelines show a single-color image. A desktop digital proof provides a
close representation of color, but it is not as accurate as a press proof.

The topic's most important facts. Because press releases provide media outlets with news about the
business, writers typically use an inverted pyramid writing style. This means that the most important
points appear in the first paragraph. The subsequent paragraphs contain less important points. Writers
often include quotes in press releases, but they do not need to appear in the first paragraph. The use of
humor depends on the topic at hand, and is often inappropriate to use at all. Depending on the
publications' formatting specifications, the writer should place the contact information at the top or at
bottom of the press release, but not within the article.

guests per bartender (300/75 = 4). Finally, add together the number of foodservice servers needed and
the number of bartenders needed (10 + 4 = 14).

Exhibits its products at trade shows frequently. Many hospitality businesses exhibit at trade shows on a
regular basis. Portable displays are ideal for these businesses because they are simple to put up,
change, and taken down and are easy to transport and store. The cost to develop a portable display
might be a large, upfront expense for the business, but it often is worth the money if the business uses
the display frequently. The travel theme and distribution method of services are not primary
considerations when using a portable display. Publicity is any nonpersonal presentation of ideas, goods,
or services that is not paid for by the company or individual that benefits from or is harmed by it.

Click-through rate. The click-through rate measures the number of times that web-site visitors click on an
online advertisement that automatically transports the visitors to the advertiser's web site. Evaluating
click-through rates of online ads helps businesses determine the effectiveness of the ad. If the clickthrough
rate for an ad on a particular web site is poor, the hotel chain may decide to stop advertising on
the web site and place an advertisement elsewhere. The gross page impressions metric measures the
web site's total traffic volume. If the hotel chain wants to determine the advertisement's price on a per
click-through basis, it would use the cost per click metric. The transactions per hour metric measures the
number of sales transactions that occur in a 60-minute timeframe.

Sales promotion. Sales promotion consists of promotional activities other than advertising, personal
selling, and publicity that stimulate customer purchases. Discounts, contests, rebates, and product
samples are examples of sales-promotion activities. In the example, the campground offers a discount to
current campers to encourage them to extend their stay, thereby reducing the campground's potential
revenue losses for unoccupied campsites. Personal selling is the form of promotion that determines the
client's needs and wants and responds through planned, personalized communication that influences
purchasing decisions and enhances future business opportunities. Publicity is any nonpersonal
presentation of ideas, goods, or services that is not paid for by the company or individual that benefits
from or is harmed by it. Advertising is any paid form of nonpersonal presentation of ideas, images, goods,
or services.

A continuous-running video that features sites such Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. Visual
displays should relate to the product that the travel agency is promoting. In the example, the travel
agency is promoting a tour of England. Showing a video that features England's tourist attractions (e.g.,
Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London) may stimulate interest in visiting England and encourage
customers to book the tour. The Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum are in France, so it is unlikely that
the travel agency would feature these sites in a display to promote a tour of England. A cardboard cutout
of Mickey Mouse and Cinderella in front of the Magic Kingdom is an appropriate display item to promote
a trip to Disneyland or Disney World. A travel agency would likely use a sombrero, beach towel, colorful
balloons and a poster of a tropical beach resort in a display promoting travel to Mexico.

Suggestion selling. Suggestion selling is a sales technique in which the salesperson attempts to increase
the customer's purchase by recommending additional items after the customer has decided to buy the
primary product. In the example, Jack attempts to increase the check amount by suggesting that his
customers buy dessert, which happens after they made (and consumed) their primary purchase
decisions—their meals. Up-selling is a sales technique in which the salesperson suggests that the
customer purchase a higher priced product rather than the one that the customer originally requests.
Substitute selling involves offering the customer a similar product when his/her original product request is
not available. Dessert is a want rather than a need.

differentiate the venue by focusing on the attributes that make the venue unique and are important to the
client (event planner). In the situation provided, the event is an awards banquet for members of the
media. Because banquets involve food service, the hotel salesperson would want to tell the client that the
hotel employs a five-star chef, which suggests that the chef prepares excellent food. Serving good food
to members of the media might result in positive publicity for the hotel. The swimming pool, number of
standard-size sleeping rooms, and the types of advertising media are not unique attributes that are likely
