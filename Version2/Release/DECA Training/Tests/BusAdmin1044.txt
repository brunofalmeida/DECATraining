Good reading skills. All business employees need to possess basic reading skills. However, employees
who are required to extract relevant information from written materials should possess good reading skills
because some of the materials may contain complex information that is difficult to understand. Good
reading skills include the ability to focus on the content and analyze and evaluate the meaning of the
message. Employees who possess good reading skills usually have extensive vocabularies and are
willing to look up the meaning of unfamiliar words. Possessing the ability to listen or an effective speaking
voice will not help employees to extract relevant information from written materials.

Achieve tasks. Business employees often are expected to apply written directions to achieve tasks, such
as operating a new piece of office equipment. When applying written directions, it is effective to follow a
step-by-step order to be able to perform the task correctly. Most written directions are explained in a
step-by-step way because they must be performed in a certain order. Employees do not apply written
directions to give commands, read materials, or take notes.

Restating directions in your own words helps clarify them. When you restate the directions, the person
giving the directions can correct any misunderstanding you may have had about what you are to do.
Listening is more than hearing. Listening is an active behavior that involves understanding, evaluating,
and responding to what is being said. Asking questions and taking notes will also help you to understand
and to follow directions accurately.

Employee is thinking of an answer. To listen effectively, employees should concentrate on what is being
said rather than think about a possible answer. Many times employees become distracted and think
about what they should say, especially if a manager is evaluating their performance. The temptation is to
develop a response rather than focus on understanding the evaluation. Employees need to make a
conscious effort to concentrate in order to listen effectively. The use of audiovisuals often helps
employees to understand directions, especially if the information is technical. Taking a few notes also
increases understanding.

Clarify the information exchanged. Verbal communication is a spoken exchange, and individuals who are
speaking to each other can ask questions in order to ensure that they clearly understand what is being
said. Written communication does not have this benefit, but it does provide a written record of the
information exchanged. Verbal communication does facilitate interaction with others and a rapid
exchange of ideas, but those are not always important or advisable in business.

7. C
Use visuals. It is often more difficult to give verbal directions than to provide written directions unless the
information is fairly simple or familiar to the audience. To overcome the problem of giving verbal
directions, it is often helpful to use visuals such as diagrams or charts. The visuals reinforce the verbal
directions and help the audience to understand the explanation. It is not helpful to speak softly, use
complex words, or limit body language when giving verbal directions. These actions may make it more
difficult for the audience to understand the directions.

Supporting ideas with research. Ideas that are research-based are more easily accepted than those that
are not. Although the research gathered may result in the boss thinking the employee intelligent, it is not
the main reason for collecting the statistics. The research does not create alternative ideas. It is meant to
add validation to the original idea. Clarifying an idea involves explaining it in more detail.

Identify the firm or department and yourself. General guidelines for answering a business telephone
include greeting the caller, identifying yourself and the business or department, and asking how you can
be of assistance to the caller. It is not always necessary to get the correct spelling of the caller's name.
Immediate action may also not be required. Callers should not be called by their first names unless they
are personal acquaintances of the individual answering the telephone.

To share many different opinions. Many businesses encourage employees to participate in group
discussions to analyze problems and find solutions. The advantage is that when employees share many
different opinions, there is an increase in the chance of developing useful recommendations. However,
for the group discussions to be useful, all members must feel comfortable and be willing to express their
opinions. Businesses do not make it possible for employees to participate in group discussions to discuss
personal issues, to plan extracurricular activities, or to have casual conversations.

To arrange findings in a logical manner. Before preparing a business report, it is important to organize
the information so the findings are arranged in a logical manner. The facts and findings should be
presented in a logical manner so readers will be able to understand the message. If the information is out
of order, the message may not be clear. Before the information can be organized, it is necessary to
understand the purpose of the report, identify the target audience, and investigate the cause of the
problem.

the sequence of activities in a process. A common flowchart is an organizational chart that depicts the
hierarchy of positions and departments within an organization. Pictographs, maps, and pie charts are
considered visual graphics rather than textual graphics. Although they may contain some words and
numbers, they also contain visuals such as bars, columns, and drawings.

Collection letter. A business sends collection letters to customers who owe the business money and have
not made arrangements to pay. Collection letters must be written carefully in order to prompt customers
to pay without threatening them in any way. A card catalog is used by libraries without computer systems
to keep track of the libraries' holdings. An exit interview is a discussion with an employee who is leaving a

Yes, employees should be well informed and able to help customers. One good way to have a customerservice
mindset is to be well informed about all aspects of a business. Although it is good to call a
customer by his/her name, if known, this is not always possible. Employees often have brief
conversations with customers. They should pay attention to customers regardless of how busy they are.

By requesting input through employee and customer surveys. Service-oriented companies are generally
committed to providing exceptional service levels. Service-oriented companies are always looking for
ways to improve their service levels. Requesting feedback from employees and customers regarding
service levels is one way businesses can evaluate and improve service. Testimonials are statements by
identified users of a product proclaiming the benefits received from the use of a product. Distributing
testimonials, evaluating product development procedures, and conducting a feasibility analysis are not
methods that businesses generally use to improve their service levels.

included?" are inquiries about a business's policies rather than about the product.

Getting feedback from. Businesses use the comments, suggestions, and other feedback from customers
to help them decide if certain policies need to be revised or changed. Feedback also helps businesses

that have helped them to acquire new customers, to satisfy current customers, or to create good relations
with customers.

oligopoly is a market structure in which there are a number of small sellers. A monopolistic competition is
a market structure in which there are many sellers producing differentiated products.

Emotional intelligence can be defined in different ways. Although the concept has been defined in

responding to them appropriately, and then doing the same with the emotions of other people. Emotional
intelligence is not the same as being an emotional person. Nor, is it "managing" emotions by ignoring
them. Emotional intelligence may be as important as (or more important than) traditional intelligence.

Prejudice. Prejudice is an opinion or judgment that is based on feelings or hearsay, rather than fact.
Prejudice is an attitude, not an act. An employer who thinks that all young people are lazy and poorly
trained is exhibiting prejudice because the employer is putting all young people into one category and is
not considering individual differences. If employers refuse to hire young people because they are
prejudiced against them, the employers are guilty of discrimination, which is unfair treatment of a person
or a group based on the person's or group's characteristics, e.g., race, gender, age., etc. Harassment is
any kind of behavior toward another person that is carried out for the purpose of annoying or threatening
the individual. Hostility involves acting in an unfriendly or menacing manner.

Willing to take positive risks. Self-confidence is a positive belief in your own talents, skills, and objectives.
Self-confident people tend to exhibit certain characteristics, such as a positive attitude, an appreciation
and acceptance of others' compliments, and a willingness to take risks. A self-confident person can
express his/her own opinions or ideas even when others disagree, which involves risk taking. A selfconfident
person understands that others' ideas and opinions do not hold any more or less value that
her/his own ideas and opinions. While a self-confident person does not always agree with others, s/he
does not ridicule or criticize others for expressing their own ideas.

at school or on the job. But no matter where you are, there's a right way and a wrong way to behave. It
may or may not be easier to get away with irresponsible behavior at home. The rules at school may or

by being passed over for promotions even if they are well qualified. Coworkers and supervisors often
notice other employees' unethical behavior and may lose respect for them because of it. These
employees may be passed over for promotions because their supervisors do not trust them to do the
right thing, particularly in higher level positions that give them more authority. Employees are not harmed

Using "you" statements. When confronting another person about a conflict, it is important to be calm and

together. A technique to keep the discussion from escalating into a shouting match is by using "I"
statements and avoiding the use of "you" statements. Use "I" statements to convey your beliefs,
perceptions, and feelings. "You" statements tend to place blame or fault on the other person. As a result,
the other person tends to become defensive and angry. It is important to listen to feedback.

caused by the policyholder's vehicle. It also pays for repairs needed as a result of the accident. Health
insurance helps to pay medical bills. Whole-life insurance pays the insured's beneficiaries when the
insured dies. Property insurance covers losses to real and personal property.

Balance sheets. Businesses use the information collected through the accounting process to develop
reports that indicate their financial condition. One kind of record is the balance sheet which shows the
assets, liabilities, and overall financial condition of a business. Businesses need accurate balance sheets
in order to know whether or not they are making a profit. Purchase orders are forms identifying the prices,
discounts, dating, and transportation charges applicable to an order issued by a buyer to a seller.
Inventory forms are the records used in counting the number and type of items available in inventory.
Promissory notes are legal forms signed by a borrower promising to repay a loan.

Obtaining funds. Finance is the process of obtaining funds and using them to achieve the goals of the
business. All businesses need funds to operate, so decisions about obtaining funds are very important.
Businesses decide if it is necessary to borrow money, increase prices to generate more income, or take
other actions to obtain funds. The role of finance in business does not involve paying employees, buying
supplies, or monitoring expenses. However, finance is involved in obtaining the funds necessary to pay
employees and buy supplies. Finance involves using funds to operate, such as paying expenses rather
than monitoring expenses.

Recruiting. The part of staffing that involves seeking out and attracting qualified potential job candidates
is called recruiting. HR managers have many different methods for recruitment, and they will choose the
ones that are most appropriate to their industry and the position(s) available. Training is an HR
management activity that ensures employees are knowledgeable and productive. On-boarding is an HR
management activity that gets a new employee started on the job. Interviewing comes after recruiting
recruiting produces potential candidates to interview.

Promotion. The purpose of the promotion function of marketing is to communicate information about
goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome. Some of the ways to communicate
with customers include advertising, publicity, and sales promotion. Sending discount coupons to potential
customers is a promotional form of communication intended to encourage customers to buy. Financing is
the business function which determines the need for and availability of financial resources to aid in
marketing activities. Selling is the marketing function which involves determining client needs and wants
and responding through planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and
enhances future business opportunities. Product/Service management involves obtaining, developing,
maintaining, and improving a product or service mix in response to market opportunities.

Specific problems. Businesses need a variety of information to be able to make decisions and solve
problems. The type of information they need depends on the business and the specific problem. For
example, a retail business might need information about different suppliers because the current supplier
is not performing adequately and the business wants to find a replacement. Businesses do not assess
their information needs to deal with job applicants, personal relationships, or ethical issues.

Quality of information. For information to be useful, it must be accurate and current. Therefore,
businesses evaluate the quality of information they obtain to determine if it is relevant to the issue,
accurate, and current. Information that is out-of-date or that includes errors will not help the business.
The business might make poor decisions based on using information that is of low quality. Businesses do
not evaluate the research procedure, type of statistics, or hardware application to determine if data are
accurate and current.

Information. Information is knowledge, facts, or data. A company collects and analyzes a variety of
information to make wise decisionsdecisions that are in the best interest of the company and its
success. Because the company makes a variety of decisions, it needs to effectively manage all of the
information so that it is available when the business wants it. Some types of information the company
needs in order to make business decisions include product demand levels, markets, and product ratings
(e.g., government grades).

Database. A database is a collection (or file) of related information about a specific topic. Many
businesses collect information about their customers and store this information in computer databases.
Then, businesses can access this information at any time for a variety of reasons, such as tracking
customers geographically. Spreadsheet software is used to organize, calculate, and analyze numerical
data. Word-processing software is used to create text documents. The Internet is not a software
application program.

Forwarding the message to the coworker's e-mail address. Many businesses have e-mail systems that
allow employees to communicate with each other. The e-mail forward option allows an e-mail message to
be sent to e-mail users other than the sender. The reply option is used when the e-mail recipient
responds to the message sender. Posting a message in a secured e-mail folder does not ensure that the
coworker will read the message. Although the message can be printed and handed to the coworker, it is
not the most efficient way to communicate the information.

Time-management tool. Many employees keep track of their activities and organize their daily schedules

device is not an example of a communication system, a web-based program, or a presentation
application.

Be as specific as possible. By being as specific as possible, results are narrowed to the most relevant
material, which saves the researcher time from reading through unnecessary information. For example, if
an individual is researching information on George Washington, the researcher should enter the
keywords "George Washington" rather than "presidents" to retrieve the most relevant information.
"Presidents" is a very broad, general term. The researcher would need to sift through much more
information to obtain the needed information. Generally, most search engines are not case sensitive so it
does not matter how the letters are entered into the query. Most search engines can conduct searches
with more than 10 characters in the query field.

Allow employees to have access to the same information. Employees often work together to complete
projects, and many of these employees work in different locations. Groupware computer software allows
employees to share and access the same information from a variety of locations. The ability to access
the same information allows each employee to have the necessary data to complete his/her portion of the
project in a timely manner. By completing projects in a timely manner, businesses are in a better position
to satisfy clients/customers and earn profits, which might increase their market share. Some businesses
use groupware computer software to exchange information with their customers, but this depends on the
type of business and the relationship with the customer. Groupware computer software can be used in
many ways, including training, but the primary purpose is to make information available to the people
who need it.

An overview of the content that is visually interesting. The first thing a reader should see on a web page
is the basic, rather than detailed, information about the web-page sponsor. Then, readers should be able
to click on links to connect them to more detailed information or items of interest. To capture the reader's
attention, the page should be visually interesting, which includes the appropriate use of color and smaller
graphics. Since larger graphics tend to take longer to appear on the computer screen, some individuals
might become frustrated because they must wait. Oftentimes, people will not go beyond the initial screen
if they feel it takes too long. Therefore, it is preferable to use smaller graphics. Typefaces should be
limited since too many of them can be visually distracting.

Routinely inspect equipment. Some businesses operate equipment that may present a safety hazard if
the equipment is not operating properly. As a result, certain health and safety regulations require these
businesses to routinely inspect equipment to make sure it is safe. In some cases, government inspectors
routinely visit the business to inspect equipment. If the inspectors find that the equipment is
malfunctioning, they have the authority to force the business to stop using the equipment until it has been
repaired and inspected again. Health and safety regulations do not require businesses to purchase new
machinery, offer exercise programs, or install security cameras.

Provide training. Depending on the type of business, employees may be required to use equipment and
machinery that may be complicated to operate. To help employees follow instructions and use the
equipment and machinery in a safe manner, it is often necessary to provide training. During training,
employees learn correct operating procedures which will minimize the possibility of accidents or injuries.
Displaying first aid posters or installing a sprinkler system will not help employees follow instructions for
the use of equipment and machinery. Depending on the equipment or machinery, employees may be
required to wash their hands before or after use.

Know the proper way to respond. Businesses should have established guidelines for employees to follow
if accidents occur. And, employees should learn their employer's procedures for handling accidents so
they can respond appropriately if an accident occurs. Not all employees are expected to have formal
medical training. The Good Samaritan Law is in effect in most states to protect individuals from liability
when they administer accepted first-aid techniques. Employees need to know whether they are covered
by such a law. Understanding the accident report form is only part of the procedure.

Evaluate the situation. The first step that an employee should take when an emergency occurs is to
evaluate or assess the situation. The employee must determine what the problem is before s/he takes
action. If the employee encounters an unconscious customer, s/he would check the customer's airways
and pulse and call for an emergency medical squad for assistance. If the employee sees a fire in the
building, s/he should follow the business's procedures, which would likely include actions such as
advising others, activating the fire alarm, evacuating (leaving) the building, and notifying the fire
department. The employee would call the police department when dangerous situations (e.g., robberies)
occur.

Has enough items on hand to run the business smoothly. Businesses need supplies so that they can
operate efficiently. If a business runs out of printer toner, it cannot print letters, reports, or invoices, or
conduct other activities that are necessary to keep the business up and running. To reduce the risk of
running out of supplies, businesses often develop inventory control systems to track their supplies. Since
the DEF Company is a consulting firm, it sells services, and therefore, does not sell the office supplies to
customers. Generally, small companies do not need as many office supplies as big companies. Because
DEF is a small company, it probably does not purchase too many items in bulk. Suppliers do not always
offer free shipping. Businesses do not incur storage costs if their supplies are stored on their premises.

Because the employer is paying the employee, the employer expects the employee to arrive on time

business money because s/he is not doing the work that the employer is paying him/her to do. Other
expectations that an employer might have of its employees are to understand the employer's policies,
perform work in a safe manner, and make suggestions for improvement.
