Vertical conflict. Vertical conflict occurs between channel members at different levels within the
same channel. In the example, the distributors might feel that the manufacturer has set unreasonable
sales goals, which may cause vertical conflict. If the distributors do not reach their sales goals,
the manufacturer will drop the less productive channel members, thereby reducing the size of the
distribution channel. Distribution patterns are the strategies (intensive, selective, or exclusive) that
businesses use to move products through the distribution channel. There is not enough information
provided about the manufacturer’s distribution patterns to determine their impact on changes within
the distribution channel. Comparative advantage is the advantage achieved by a nation when it
specializes in producing goods and services at which it is relatively most efficient.

are no substitute goods or services readily available. In many countries, monopolies are illegal. The
government regulates promotion. Tying agreements do not limit liability.

Sales forecast. A sales forecast is a prediction of future sales over a specific period of time. When a
business shares its sales forecast with its vendors, they have time to plan and make sure that they have
the products available when and where the products are needed. An annual report, a cash-flow analysis,
and a media schedule do not provide the information that vendors need to plan their inventory and
delivery strategies.

Territorial boundaries. Horizontal conflicts are disagreements between channel members at the same
level of distribution. Unclear territorial boundaries or violations of those boundaries are often sources
of horizontal conflict. For example, suppose two retailers are located on the same block, and one
store begins to sell the same line of specialty goods that the other store sells. Because both stores
are competing for the same customers, conflict is likely to occur. Vertical conflicts are disagreements
between channel members at different levels of the distribution channel. If a producer decides to use
a direct distribution strategy (bypass its distributors and sell directly to end users), vertical conflict is
likely to occur. Transportation issues and shipping errors may cause occasional vertical conflict.

To order supplies, employees must complete the R-3 form and then give it to their immediate
supervisor. Businesses develop policies and procedures to ensure that employees carry out business
activities in fair and systematic ways. Policies are general rules to be followed by company personnel,
and procedures are the step-by-step processes personnel follow in performing specific tasks. Because
the correct answer states the steps of a process (ordering supplies), it is a procedure. Dress codes,
vacation time, and reimbursement rates are examples of policies because they are general in nature.

Fidgeting with accessories. Shaking hands, swaying, and fidgeting with things such as jewelry or a
pen are gestures that often indicate to the audience that the speaker is nervous. A speaker should be
aware of and monitor these types of gesture when giving an oral presentation because they can be
distracting to the audience. Practicing the presentation in front of a trusted friend or colleague may help
an individual feel more comfortable speaking in front of others. Maintaining eye contact and standing up
straight are ways in which a speaker can convey confidence during an oral presentation. Speaking too
fast or too low are verbal cues that the speaker may be nervous.

Elizabeth structures a national insurance company’s financial reports by branch. Geographical order
puts information in order based on the geographic location, such as business region or branch. When
a business wants to evaluate or compare the financial performance of each business location, the
geographic organizational approach is appropriate to use. Ben is organizing information for school
rather than business and is using a chronological format for his timeline. The chronological format
involves placing information in sequence according to time. Corrine is organizing information by value
because she is listing homes by selling price. Jacob is using the deductive approach to organize his

The bibliography. A bibliography is a list of resources containing the information that the writer used
to prepare a written document. When developing formal research reports, the writer should use the
appropriate writing style for all components of the report to build credibility with the audience. The
writing style that the writer uses depends on the business’s preferences or the type of report. For
example, the American Psychological Association (APA) style is often used when writing about topics
related to social sciences. An index is typically placed in the back of a publication and lists the subjects,
names, and companies that are referenced in a book along with the page numbers in which they appear.
A glossary is a list of terms with their definitions. An executive summary, which is usually placed at the
beginning of a long report, provides an overview of the entire document.

The salesperson provided inaccurate information. Product returns are costly to a business, but
businesses can take steps to lower product-return rates. Because salespeople are in contact with
customers, they can lower return rates by learning about the business’s products and applying that
knowledge to provide customers with accurate information. Businesses can help salespeople gain
product knowledge by providing product training. By training salespeople about products, businesses
can reduce the risks associated with salespeople giving incorrect product information, as described
in the example provided. There is not enough information provided to determine if the product was
defective or labeled incorrectly or if the salesperson used high-pressure sales tactics.

Customer-experience management strategies. Customer-experience management consists of the
strategies, processes, and policies that a business uses to meet or exceed customer expectations
and provide customers with outstanding experiences at every touch point. Touch points are the
opportunities that businesses have to connect with customers and reinforce their brand value. In the
example, the customers’ experiences are enhanced by the smell of fresh bread and the opportunity
to taste samples of different breads throughout the store. Product development is the stage in the
creation of a new product in which a working model may be tested, modified, and retested. Operations
management is the process of planning, controlling, and monitoring the day-to-day activities required
for continued business functioning. Brand insistence is the stage of brand loyalty in which consumers
insist upon buying a specific brand. Advertising is a paid form of nonpersonal promotion.

Innovation management. Innovative management is a management style that embraces active
participation throughout all levels of the organization. Company leaders tend to take roles that are more
helpful and nurturing than controlling under this management style, which supports a creative work
culture and encourages idea sharing. Because employees are carrying out the work, they often have
ideas that will help them perform more efficiently or serve customers more effectively. Competitive
aggression is a drive to win scarce customer dollars in the marketplace. Cultural intelligence means
being sensitive to the customs and traditions of people from different cultural backgrounds. Proactive
management, which involves anticipating and advanced planning for change, helps businesses adapt
more quickly than a reactive approach.

Progressive. A progressive tax structure is one in which those who earn more are required to pay a
higher percentage of their income in taxes. In other words, as a person’s income bracket increases, his/
her tax rate also increases. The U.S. income tax is a progressive tax. If using a regressive tax structure,
people who earn more income pay a lower percentage of income in taxes. As income increases, the
tax rate decreases. Sales and excise taxes are regressive taxes because people with lower incomes
ultimately pay a larger percentage of their income in sales and excise taxes. A proportional tax structure
is one in which everyone pays the same percentage of income in taxes, regardless of income level.
Businesses that are structured as corporations pay corporate taxes.

Purchasing power decreases. Inflation, which is a rise in prices, decreases purchasing power because it
takes more money to buy the same item. This means that consumers and businesses buy less with the

level of production efficiency does not always increase when inflation increases.

They can change over time. Secondary dimensions of diversity are differences that may change at
various points throughout one’s lifetime and include characteristics such as language, religion, income,
geographic location, family status, work experience, communication style, and education level. Physical
traits and mental aptitudes are primary dimensions of diversity, which are inborn differences that cannot
be changed. These differences include gender, age, race/ethnicity, etc. Subculture is a secondary group
within a dominant culture. For example, suppose that a U.S. citizen has parents of Chinese decent; the
Western culture is most likely the person’s dominant culture, while his/her Chinese heritage represents
a subculture. A person’s subculture may influence some of a person’s secondary dimensions of diversity,

It serves as a guide for decision making. When a shared vision exists, all members of the organization
understand and support the organization’s purpose. Successful organizations set goals and make
decisions to fulfill the organization’s purpose, which is based on the vision. A shared vision does not
ensure that goals are achievable. Groupthink is a form of extreme cohesiveness that occurs when
individuality and independent thinking within the group is discouraged. Ethnocentrism is the belief
that your own culture is naturally better than other cultures. Unattainable goals, ethnocentrism, and
groupthink tend to create circumstances that hinder an organization’s ability to achieve its purpose.

Jason accepts credit for Tori’s advertising campaign idea during a meeting with management. Political
relationships in the work environment involve building alliances with managers and colleagues to
maximize leverage within the organization. While political relationships (often called office politics)
facilitate beneficial results for the business, some individuals use negative tactics to obtain leverage
for their own purposes. One of these tactics involves taking credit for another person’s idea or work.
By taking credit for another person’s work, the individual is trying to make himself/herself look
competent at the expense of others. This type of behavior typically creates a negative, distrustful work
environment. Volunteering to work on a project, giving sincere compliments, and dressing professionally
are good ways to build positive business relationships.

Investors have access to a fund manager’s expertise. A mutual fund is a type of ownership investment
that involves collecting money from many people and then investing it in an assortment of different
securities such as stocks or bonds. The benefit to shareholders of placing money in mutual funds is
that a well-trained fund manager has the expertise to make smart investment decisions on their behalf.
Shareholders are not guaranteed a minimal amount of return on their mutual-fund investments, but
because the funds are spread out among different securities, the risk of a total financial loss is reduced.
Disadvantages to investing in mutual funds are that shareholders pay fees for someone to manage their
investments, and the mutual-fund earnings are taxable.

Identify a trend. One reason that businesses analyze financial information is to identify trends. In
the example, the company’s sales for a certain product have decreased over time, which indicates
a problem. With this information, the company can take steps to determine the reason for the sales
decline so it can take corrective action. For example, the business might survey customers and ask them
about their experiences with the product. If the customers say that the product is inferior or defective,
the business might decide to drop the item from its product line. The financial information did not help
Samantha calculate liquidity ratios, make a pricing decision, or negotiate a contract.

Buildings, vehicles, and capital equipment. A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the

capital equipment—that businesses use to generate revenue for more than a year. Inventory and cash

increase sales to achieve the desired profit levels. Depending on the situation, the business might be
able to change its operating procedures to improve performance. Analyzing budget variances will not

A quick-serve restaurant introduces a breakfast burrito to a limited segment of the market to determine
product acceptability. The quick-serve restaurant is test marketing a new product, which is a type of
causal research. Causal research focuses on cause and effect and tests “what if” scenarios. The answer
exemplifies the “what if” scenario because the quick-serve restaurant wants to know what the market’s
response will be if it adds a breakfast burrito to its menu options. Marketers use exploratory research
to help them define an issue, situation, or concern. Businesses often use existing data such as sales
invoices to conduct exploratory research. A focus group is one method that marketers use to conduct

items and brands and why they select specific items. After the marketing researchers collect the diaries,
they can analyze the data and gain insight about the participants’ buying habits. A blog is an online
diary in which individuals or groups (e.g., businesses and media outlets) post information and typically
provide readers with opportunities to comment about the content. In the situation provided, marketing

Avoid appearing biased. A personal interview is one way to collect detailed, qualitative marketingresearch
data. When marketing researchers conduct interviews, it is important for them to make the
interviewees feel comfortable and willing to talk openly about the topic at hand. Interviewers should
monitor their verbal and nonverbal behavior to ensure that they appear neutral and unbiased. If an
interviewer says or does something to indicate a biased attitude, tries to influence responses, or
dominates the conversation, the interviewee may not feel comfortable answering questions honestly. If
the interviewee provides dishonest answers, the research is inaccurate or unreliable. A time limit on an
interview is not a reason for an interviewer to monitor his/her verbal and nonverbal behavior during the
interview.

Tabulating data. Tabulation involves counting the number of respondents who answered each question
with one of the possible answers that appear on a survey. For example, if 100 people answered a
questionnaire, researchers need to know how many of them agreed, disagreed, or had no opinion
about the questions. The tabulation process also helps marketing researchers identify non-response
errors which result when respondents do not answer questions. After tabulating the data, marketing
researchers can put the data in useful formats for managers to analyze and interpret. Marketing
researchers develop the sample plan and assign numerical values to potential answers before sending
the survey to the participants.

Rosanna checks two response options for one question on a paper questionnaire. A response error
occurs when a respondent provides an incorrect answer or response. Response errors often occur when
respondents do not understand the question or when they hurry to complete the survey and do not
read instructions or questions carefully. Because Rosanna provides two responses or answers for one
question, the questionnaire contains a response error. A non-response error occurs when a respondent

question is a close-ended question because it requires a “yes” or “no” answer. The situation does not
exemplify an indifferent statement, an open-ended inquiry, or an unstated alternative.

Variety-seeking. This type of buying behavior usually involves the purchase of routine items such as
crackers, shampoo, and potato chips. The buyer might be very aware of the differences among brands
but feels a desire to try something different. Because the items are relatively inexpensive, there is no
great risk in trying something new. When a buyer prefers to purchase a certain brand but will accept
substitutes if the brand is not available, the buyer has a brand preference. People who are motivated
by a desire to have the best quality, most expensive, or trendiest goods and services tend to purchase
status-oriented items. Price-oriented buyers are concerned with the product’s price and value. There is
not enough information provided to determine if Anna considered price when she purchased the potato
chips, or if she prefers a particular brand of potato chip.

Place. The marketing mix is the combination of the four elements of marketing-product, place,
promotion, and price. Place is the marketing element that focuses on getting a product in the right
place at the right time. A primary consideration of place is the customers’ accessibility to the product.
If the product is accessible through as many outlets as possible, there is a high level of convenience
for customers. Think about all the places that you can buy a Hershey’s candy bar—grocery stores,
convenience stores, drug stores, etc. On the other hand, products that are distributed through a few
channels limit customers’ accessibility to them. Luxury items such as Bentley cars are available through
a limited number of dealerships, which makes the product less accessible to customers. Product is the
marketing element that involves determining the goods, services, or ideas that the business will offer
its customers. Price is the marketing element in which marketers determine the amount of money
they will charge in exchange for their products. Promotion is the marketing element that considers the
various types of communications that marketers use to inform, persuade, or remind customers of their
products.

Psychographic. Market segmentation is dividing the market into groups that have similar characteristics.
Segmenting markets helps businesses identify the people who are most likely to buy their products.
Businesses segment markets in different ways. In the example, the athletic apparel store used
psychographics to divide the market, which means that the market is divided on the basis of a lifestyle
choice—running. Geographic segmentation involves dividing a market on the basis of location (e.g.,
zip code). Demographics are the physical and social characteristics of the population. A business that
segments the market on the basis of demographics considers factors such as the age, gender, and
ethnicity of the population. Rate of usage is a type of behavioral segmentation, which involves dividing
customers into groups according to their response to a product.

A good marketing plan contains the business’s specific marketing goals and strategies. A marketing
plan is a set of procedures or strategies for attracting the target customer to a business. A good
marketing plan is specific—it defines the business’s specific marketing goals and the specific ways
(strategies) in which the business plans to achieve those goals. As a component of the business plan,
the marketing plan is read by a wide audience (e.g., managers, potential investors, and board members)
and is important for both large and small businesses. Although writing a marketing plan can involve
quite a bit of time to research and write, it is worth the effort because it provides a solid foundation for
the business’s marketing activities.

Internal strength. A situation analysis is a determination of a company’s current business situation and
the direction in which it is headed. A comprehensive situation analysis involves evaluating the internal
and external circumstances that are currently affecting the business environment. Conducting a
situation analysis helps the company make business decisions that make the most of its strengths, such
as maintaining a comprehensive, current, and flexible database. Companies can also use the situation
analysis to improve internal weaknesses and adjust to external challenges. A comprehensive, current,
and flexible database system is not an external asset, product benefit, or technological flaw.

His company’s intranet. An intranet is an internal network similar to the Internet that is accessible
only by authorized personnel. It is used to access information and communicate with others within an
organization. A company intranet often consists of internal databases, which provide computerized
storage for information and facts. Businesses typically maintain information in their databases that
are relevant to their operations—product specifications, inventory levels, vendor contact information,
customer sales records, etc. When an employee needs information, such as the model number of a
customer’s printer, s/he can quickly obtain the customer’s sales records by accessing data stored on the
intranet, which will ensure that the employee orders the correct printer cartridge for his/her customer.
The manufacturer’s accounting department, its production manager, and the company’s contact
directory are unlikely to have the information needed.

Using a quotation to communicate product information. In this situation, the quotation provides the
reader with information about the product’s purpose—to help students learn in new ways. Lucinda
may have made the statement at a sales meeting, but there is not enough information provided to
determine when or where she said it. Because the statement is placed in quotation marks, it is written
exactly as it was spoken, rather than paraphrased. A testimonial is a statement by an identified user of a
product proclaiming the benefits received from the use of the product. The statement does not provide
any information about the product’s features, nor does it provide enough information to determine if
Lucinda has actually used the new product to provide a testimonial.

Keeping employees’ payroll records in unsecured computer databases. Businesses have an ethical
obligation to store their confidential information (e.g., payroll records) in secure and confidential ways.
One way to protect confidential information is to limit others’ accessibility to it. Requiring qualified
employees to use computer passwords to access the confidential information can reduce the risk of
unethical behavior—such as snooping or spying. Telling employees about telephone monitoring policies;
requesting customers’ permission to share their information with others; and using opt-in e-mail to
communicate with customers are ethical actions.

Records become inaccessible due to obsolete technology. As technology evolves, new tools and storage
formats replace the older, less efficient ones. For example, most of today’s computers cannot access
data stored on a floppy disk. Rather than keeping out-of-date equipment on hand to read older files,
businesses often migrate their older records to current technology, which is costly in terms of time
and money. When businesses use current technology, they can update their data and business records
quickly. Similar to manual record-keeping processes, businesses can develop and “file” their documents
on computers in organized ways. Businesses are required to keep certain types of records (e.g.,
financial) for a certain time, but they do not need to keep all documents for a minimum amount of time.

Businesses often provide ongoing training so that employees are able to keep up with technological
changes. Businesses also create and maintain a quality work culture by getting input from internal and
external sources to solve problems when needed. Emphasizing short-term gains and focusing primarily

especially of items that you do not need—tends to increase clutter. Depending on the type of work that
you do, you may need to keep hard copies on hand; therefore, you probably will not want to place all of

A long drought damages the corn crops. Crop damage yields less corn, which decreases the supply
available to meet demand. When demand is greater than supply, prices tend to increase. Because
many types of products contain corn, their prices typically go up as well. If the corn supply is high and
demand for it declines, the price of corn tends to decrease. Low or stable inflation would not cause the
price of corn to increase. Reduced marketing activities are unlikely to drive up the price of corn.

Growth. One factor that businesses consider when they adjust a product’s price is its life-cycle stage.
During the product’s growth stage, competitors are entering the market with copycat products. When
consumers have more products from which to choose, the business is likely to reduce the product’s
price to remain competitive in the marketplace. During the maturity stage of the product’s life cycle,
businesses tend to focus on stabilizing the product’s price to maintain a share of the market. Trough and

Testing on animals. Product testing on animals involves exposing animals to the product (e.g., cosmetics,

that this is an unethical practice, many companies are looking for alternative ways to test the safety of
their products. Collusion or price fixing is an illegal practice in which businesses agree on the prices of
their goods or services, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Bait-and-switch advertising occurs
when a business promotes a low-priced item to attract customers to whom it then tries to sell a higher
priced item. Setting unrealistic sales goals is an ethical issue related to the selling function.

Attribute listing. Programmed thinking is a process that involves generating ideas in logical,
analytical, and organized ways. Attribute listing is an idea-generation technique that involves listing
the characteristics or attributes of something and then finding ways to improve these attributes.
For example, suppose that a business wants to improve a bike. The business would begin by listing
attributes of the bike—the wheels, seat, frame, gears, chain, etc. When listing the attributes, the business
might decide that it could improve the seat by using different padding or by changing the shape of the
seat to make it more comfortable for the rider. Mind mapping, forced questioning, and synectics are
idea-generation techniques that use lateral thinking, which is a process that involves generating ideas in
purposely illogical ways.

it will replace a specific part (motor) of the lawnmower if it does not work properly; therefore, it is
providing the customer with a limited warranty on the product. A full warranty is a warranty that covers
the entire product. A guarantee is a promise made to the consumer that a product’s purchase price will
be refunded if the product is not satisfactory.

List all ingredients on the products’ packaging. Listing the ingredients on food packaging allows
consumers to read the contents of processed foods. This is important because consumers who are
allergic to certain foods or food additives can determine if the product is safe for them to eat by
reviewing the ingredients that are listed on the packaging. Hazardous product symbols are typically
added to the packages of non-food Items (e.g., cleaning products) that contain dangerous chemicals.
Many governments require food manufacturers to include nutritional information on their labels or
packaging; however, this requirement is not tied specifically to allergies. It is important to seal packages
to prevent product tampering but this will not prevent people from accidentally consuming foods to
which they are allergic.

Product cannibalization. Businesses watch and adjust their product lines to meet customers’ changing
needs and wants, which helps them compete effectively in the marketplace and generate profits. A
business might decide to remove a product from its product mix to avoid or eliminate cannibalization,
which occurs when the sale of one of a company’s products takes away sales from another product.
In short, the business will give up one product to extend the life cycle of another product. Alteration
is a product-mix strategy that involves making changes to the company’s products or lines. Alteration
may involve completely redesigning a product or changing things such as color, style, or packaging.
Substitution involves using a similar product in place of another good or service. A business might
substitute one or a few products, but it is unlikely to substitute items for its entire inventory. Inventory
shrinkage involves inventory losses due to shoplifting, employee theft, breakage, misplaced goods, or
poor record keeping.

Often lowers the marketing costs. Product bundling involves combining several products and selling

products for one low price communicates value to consumers and may reduce their comparison
shopping activities, but comparison shopping cannot be eliminated. Bundling products does not reduce
product-quality problems, but changes in production processes might improve the quality of products.
Product placement is a form of advertising media that uses products as props (e.g., in films or television
shows). Product bundling does not usually decrease a business’s promotion goals in relation to productplacement.

Associating an artificial sweetener with sugar. Positioning is a product mix strategy in which a business

order requires a marketer to stop running a questionable advertisement until a hearing is held
to determine if the advertisement is inappropriate or misleading. Corrective advertising explains and
amends information that was deceiving in a previous advertisement. Affirmative disclosure is a type of
corrective action in which the government orders the advertiser to include product information in future
advertisements that it omitted in its previous advertisements.

Push money. To increase market visibility, manufacturers often use incentive programs to motivate their
independent sales consultants or distributors. These incentives, which are often called push money,
may include cash bonuses, prizes, gift cards, or vacations. Typically, independent sales consultants must
reach a certain level of sales to obtain push money. Sweepstakes involve games of chance in which
customers win prizes. Manufacturers develop cooperative advertising programs to provide channel
members with financial assistance to offset product advertising expenses. The purpose of loyalty or
frequency programs is to build long-term customer relationships by offering incentives that encourage
repeat sales. For example, a pizza chain might give customers a free pizza after they buy six pizzas of
similar value.

Copy. The purpose of the copy (text) is to communicate information about the product. An illustration
is a graphic element. The headline is a phrase that is placed at the top of an advertisement that is
used to attract attention. The tag line (slogan) is a phrase that is easy to remember and is often used
throughout a business’s promotional efforts to reinforce the company’s brand.

Public-relations activity for a charitable cause. The purpose of the public-relations function is to
establish goodwill between the business and its various publics. One way for a business to build
goodwill with the community is by participating in charitable events. This might involve providing
financial support, goods (e.g., energy bars), or volunteers for the event. A media blitz is an intense effort
to communicate information through all possible channels. There is not enough information provided
to determine if event organizers used media blitz to publicize the race. The snack-food company is not
engaging in a selling activity or an advertising campaign. These activities are not part of the publicrelations
business function.

Local businesses, charitable organizations, and customers. The purpose of the public-relations function
is to establish goodwill between the business and its various publics or audiences. External audiences
include local businesses, charitable organizations, customers, government agencies, and the community
at large. Internal audiences include the company’s employees, executive managers, and board of
directors (if the company is a corporation).

Booth rental space. Trade shows are events where businesses display and/or demonstrate their
products to build sales leads and interest. A business considers many factors when deciding if it should
participate in a particular trade show. There are many costs associated with trade shows including
employees’ travel and lodging expenses, booth rental space, audio/visual rentals and Internet hookups,
display shipping costs, etc. The target audience size, venue appeal, and competitors’ attendance are
considerations that do not relate to budgeting.

Tactics. A promotional plan is a framework for the promotional activities of a business. A primary reason
for developing a promotional plan is to create effective communication programs that will help the
business achieve its marketing goals. A comprehensive promotional plan outlines the specific tactics
or actions that the business will use to carry out its promotional strategies. Objectives are the desired
outcomes that the business hopes to achieve by carrying out the various tactics. The budget is a tool
that projects the expenses and income related to the promotional activities. The evaluation component
describes how the business plans to measure the success of its promotional activities.

Having favorable adjustment and return policies. Salespeople are the employees who interact with
customers, but the business sets the policies that they must follow. Customers like to know that they
can return products if they are not satisfied. Therefore, having liberal return policies helps create
customer loyalty and repeat business. In most cases, customers do not take advantage of these policies
but appreciate the convenience that they offer. Salespeople can take steps to increase their clientele
by following up with customers and by showing interest in the customers’ needs and their concerns.
Although sales goals are necessary, setting unrealistic or overly high performance goals does not help
salespeople build a clientele.

Selling-activity. The details regarding quotas for each salesperson would be outlined in a selling-activity
policy. Selling-activity policies involve salespeople’s interactions with customers. Terms-of-sale policies
involve the parts of the sale that concern customers most (e.g., pricing, discounts, etc.). Service policies
involve what happens after the sale. Qualifying the customer is another selling-activity policy that
involves ensuring that a customer is right for the purchase.

Webinar. A webinar is a live, interactive, online meeting. The advantage of holding a webinar is that
the presenter can communicate information to people who are in different physical locations. Because
employees can access the computers from different locations, a webinar is a cost-effective way to
hold a sales meeting because it reduces the company’s travel expenses. A global positioning system
(GPS) is an electronic device that provides drivers with accurate directions to destinations. Data-mining
software searches different computer databases to look for patterns and relationships among data.
Autoresponder is an e-mail function that automatically returns a specified message to anyone who
e-mailed a particular address.

Yes. The salesperson is suggesting reciprocity, which is illegal if it hinders competition. Reciprocity
occurs when one company agrees to buy products from a second company only if the second company
agrees to buy products from the first company. This sales practice usually is considered illegal if it
eliminates competition or prevents the second company from buying from other suppliers. Price
discrimination is an illegal activity in which a business charges different customers different prices for
similar amounts and types of products. A limited partnership is a partnership agreement in which a
partner’s liability is limited to the amount of the investment. Tie-in sales tactics (also known as tying
agreements) are illegal arrangements that require customers to buy other products in order to obtain
desired goods and services.

Attending a training session. Salespeople often attend training sessions to acquire product knowledge
so that they can clearly explain complex products to their customers. Often, manufacturing
representatives will train salespeople to ensure that they thoroughly understand the product, which
will help them provide customers with accurate product information. A product brochure is unlikely to
contain detailed information about a complex product. Asking a customer about the product might be
appropriate with some types of items; however, the manufacturers have detailed information available
for complex products. Salespeople must learn about the product before they can conduct a product
demonstration for their customers.

Multiple uses. Salespeople are more likely to make a sale if they clearly communicate a product’s
features and benefits. Some products perform multiple functions, which are features that provide
benefits—customers do not need to buy individual items to perform each function. The vacuum cleaner
can perform several functions—it sweeps up dirt from carpets and floors; it has attachments to remove
dust from furniture, draperies, and ceiling fans; and it deep cleans carpets. The example does not
communicate information about the vacuum cleaner’s construction, durability, or style.

Customers tend to return fewer products. Discovering customer needs is the phase of the selling
process in which the salesperson determines what a customer needs or wants by asking questions
and listening to the customer’s responses. When salespeople determine what their customers really
want, they can select the most appropriate product to show them. In turn, customers are more likely to
be satisfied with their purchases and less likely to return products, which is a benefit to the business.
Customers often post product reviews—positive and negative—on the businesses’ web sites. When
salespeople take time to discover customer needs, customers tend to be happier with their purchases
and therefore more likely to provide favorable product reviews. A higher commission is a potential
benefit to salespeople. Salespeople, rather than customers, qualify sales leads.

Emotional. Emotional buying motives are based on feelings or emotions. In the example, Mr. and Mrs.
Green were motivated by the fear of home burglary. Buying and installing a home-security system
appeal to their need to feel safe and protected from intruders. Esteem is another emotional buying
motive, which usually involves buying status-oriented products. Patronage motives are reasons for
buying that are based on loyalty to a particular business. Rational motives are reasons that involve the
use of logic or reasoning to make the buying decision.
