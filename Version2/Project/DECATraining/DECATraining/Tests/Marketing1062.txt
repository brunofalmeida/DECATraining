Reduced risk of failure. The business-format franchise arrangement requires a close and continuous
working relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee. Franchisors often provide training,
financial guidance, and supply chains. Franchisees benefit from the franchisor's national advertising
programs since they operate under the trade name. This type of assistance reduces the franchisee's risk
of business failure. Disadvantages of the business-format franchise include strict operating hours, limited
number of vendors, and uniform store appearance.

middlemen available at the same level of a channel.

Distribution. Distribution uses technology for storage, product handling, inventory control, and order
processing. The use of new technology makes it easier for channel members to share information and
track the distribution of goods. Technology in planning is often used to collect and analyze research
information. Technology in pricing is often used to verify credit or debit a sale. Technology in promotion is
often used to create advertising and unique displays.

Products are available to meet the demand. Channel members are the businesses or individuals who
assist in moving goods and services from the producer to the consumer. When one channel member is
planning a sales promotion, it should advise the other channel members so they can make sure products
are available when and where they are needed to meet increased demand. If the channel member does
not tell the producer about the sales promotion, it may not produce enough products to send to the
channel member to sell to the end users. Transporters (e.g., trucking companies) do not usually need to
hire order takers for another channel member's sales promotion. Although advising the producer about a
sales promotion may reduce inventory stock-outs, the risk cannot be eliminated. Inventory shrinkage is
the loss of inventory due to shoplifting, employee theft, breakage, misplaced goods, or poor
recordkeeping.

 7. C
Authority to demand cooperation. Strong leaders have the authority and power to influence others and
direct the actions of others. A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to avoid
conflict within the channel because the leader has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and
demand cooperation, which reduces the possibility of conflict. The leader's authority makes it possible for
the leader to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member and persuade members to
accomplish their individual tasks. When each member is cooperating and working for the good of the
channel, there is less chance of conflict. It is not necessary for the leader to develop friendships. Channel
leaders usually do not provide training. It is not possible to regulate change, although an effective leader
will help channel members adjust to change.

Present supporting research for her suggestions in an unbiased way. By providing supporting facts,
Morgan can actually show the staff how and why her ideas can improve the department's productivity. If
Morgan presents research that indicates that other companies' productivity levels have improved by
using approaches similar to the one that she is suggesting, then she is defending her ideas effectively.
Telling Jacob in front of the group that his ideas are weak is likely to create unnecessary conflict.
Restating suggestions, coming up with new ideas, and asking other group members for input are not
ways to defend an existing suggestion for improvement.

Project the image of the business. The way in which employees handle telephone calls projects the
image of the business and its level of service. Handling calls in a businesslike manner can increase
business. Using professional telephone techniques includes making the caller feel important, and not
trying to be important. Being businesslike may enable employees to handle a great many calls or to
qualify for promotion, but these are not primary objectives.

Determine the purpose or nature of the message. Oral presentations are given to provide entertainment,

know the purpose of the presentation before s/he can gather information or research for the message or

not the first element of the presentation that the speaker considers.

Collection letter. A collection letter is a type of persuasive message that many businesses write to
customers who are delinquent in making payments on their accounts. The purpose of the collection letter
is to persuade customers to send payment or to contact the business to make some type of arrangement.
Collection letters should not offend customers but should convince them to respond immediately. Many
businesses write electronic mail, handwritten notes, and interoffice memos, but these types of messages
are not necessarily persuasive.

To help employees do a good job. One of the most important reasons for businesses to have effective
staff communication is to help employees do a good job. Employees need to receive accurate directions
and instructions on what is expected of them in order to do their jobs correctly. Supervisors need to be
able to communicate this information to employees and be able to answer any questions. Without
adequate communication, employees will not understand their role in the business and will not be able to
do a good job. The purpose of staff communication is not intended to encourage personal relationships,
develop business contacts, or promote social interaction.

Empathetic. An important part of building positive customer/client relations involves the way the
business's employees treat the customers. When employees are consistently courteous, knowledgeable,
and helpful, customers are likely to return to the business. To help customers, employees should try to be
empathetic. Empathy is the ability to relate to another person's thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
Employees who can “step into their customers' shoes” are able to see things from their customers'
viewpoints. Being empathic can help calm angry customers, resolve problems quickly, and identify goods
and services that will satisfy the customers' needs. A resourceful person has the ability to get the
necessary things to perform a task or complete a project. A knowledgeable person has accurate or
necessary information. An accommodating person gives others what they want. The ability to see things
from a customer's viewpoint is not an example of being a resourceful, knowledgeable, or accommodating
person.

Store policy. When a business has policies for its employees to follow in handling complaints, the

terms that businesses commonly use.

Determining what will put it in reach of its goals. Since Stacey's Steamers is acting with its long-term
success in mind, deciding to add a self-serve laundromat should put the business in reach of its goals.
This decision is part of strategic management. Establishing a system for retrieving information is part of
information management. Promoting a new service to potential customers is part of marketing. While
organizing the business to meet business objectives is part of strategic management, it is not what
Stacey's Steamers demonstrated in this example. Organizing would involve setting up the business to be

Limit economic freedom. The private enterprise system provides a great many economic freedoms, but it
does have certain limits. Laws that have been created to protect everyone, such as prohibiting the sale of
unsafe products, are limits to economic freedom. Therefore, businesses do not have the freedom to sell
dangerous products to consumers. Laws that prohibit the sale of unsafe products are not examples of
factors that promote competition, reduce inflation, or increase production.

Demand for products. When the economy is stable and growing, people have confidence in the future of
the economy and increase spending. An increase in spending leads to an increase in demand for
products, which also leads to an increase in production. When production increases, more people have
jobs and money to spend, which also increases demand for products. This situation stimulates a
continued growth in the economy. An increase in interest rates and unemployment levels often leads to a
decrease in consumer spending. Increased spending does not lead to an increase in the scarcity of
resources.

The underground economy. An underground economy is one in which money transactions take place
(such as tips received in a restaurant), but since no record is made of the transaction and the income is
not reported to the government, the GDP does not reflect the exchange. The underground economy
actually reduces the GDP. An uncounted production involves goods and services that are not sold in the
marketplace so their value can only be estimated. Double counting involves counting a product or service
more than once. Accuracy in counting refers to the vast amount of information that must be collected to
calculate GDP which can easily lead to error in the final figure.

Posture. There are many verbal and nonverbal methods to express your feelings and thoughts. Your
posture, or the way that you carry yourself, is one way that you communicate your feelings and feelings.
A person who stands tall communicates a feeling of self-confidence. On the other hand, a person who
slouches often communicates a feeling of insecurity. Gestures involve movement—a nod, a wink, a
wave.

Self-confidence. Taking initiative usually means accomplishing more. This increases confidence in one's

procrastination—the tendency to put things off.

Use of video cameras. Some businesses, such as retail establishments, use video cameras to monitor
customers and prevent shoplifting. If these cameras are focused on employees, it might be considered a
violation of the employees' privacy. Businesses that use video cameras should inform employees so they
are aware that their actions are being recorded and monitored. Also, the business has an obligation not
to use cameras in areas that are designed specifically for employees, such as break rooms. The use of
time clocks is a method of recording time on the job rather than a violation of privacy. The use of security
guards is a safety factor that benefits employees and customers. The use of computer passwords
provides employees with a certain amount of privacy by allowing them to protect their computer systems
from unauthorized access.

Making appropriate eye contact with the interviewer. Appropriate eye contact means looking people in
the eye without staring fixedly at them. People who are self-confident are not afraid to look others in the
eye. They also speak in a moderate tone of voice that can easily be heard without being loud. Speaking
in a very low tone is more likely to indicate timidity than self-confidence. Listening without interrupting
demonstrates courtesy and good manners. Wearing casual clothes to a job interview indicates poor
judgment rather than self-confidence.

Do not vote. Consensus building is the group's process of coming to an agreement. However, the
members do not vote because voting involves being for or against a decision. The side with the greater
number of votes wins. In consensus building, no one wins because all of the members come to an
agreement. Each group member's opinion is of value and each member contributes to reaching an
agreement. Therefore, each member has equal power. Consensus building does not involve following the
leader or accepting majority rule.

Tax deductions. Tax deductions are expenses that can be subtracted from gross income. For example,
working parents can deduct or subtract a certain amount of their incomes for the childcare expenses they
incur while at work. Other examples of tax deductible expenses include college tuition, home mortgage
interest, and charitable donations. Capital gains are taxes on earnings from the appreciation of an
investment. Dividends are a portion of a company's profits that are paid to shareholders. A rebate is a
part of the price that a customer pays for a good or service, which is usually offered by the product's
manufacturer.

To identify trends. Through financial-information analysis, businesses can recognize what products are
selling well and in what colors, styles, models, and sizes. Over time, this helps businesses spot trends in
customer buying habits so that the businesses provide more of the products customers are buying and
less of those that are not selling well. Selling strategies are largely determined by the nature of the
product being sold rather than by financial information. Focus groups are used to collect customer
reactions to and opinions about product features or company image. Businesses function in economic
systems rather than creating them.

advantages employees receive in addition to their monetary compensation, such as health insurance,
retirement accounts, paid vacation and sick time, etc. Employee contracts may include terms involving
commission or bonuses, but these forms of compensation are not types of contracts. Employeeassistance

Primary. Primary data are facts that a business collects for a specific purpose or project. A focus group is
a group that forms to discuss a specific topic. A business might form a focus group of customers to
gather first-hand information (opinions) about its goods and services. The data are used to help the
business resolve a problem or make decisions about product development, customer service, etc.
Secondary data are facts that are collected for purposes other than the issue or project at hand.
Statistical data are numerical facts. Oftentimes, businesses will assign numerical values to qualitative
information to obtain statistics. Complementary is not a type of marketing-research data.

Itemized. Businesses often develop questionnaires to distribute to consumers in order to obtain relevant
marketing information. The questions are often designed to require respondents to select one of a few
options. The Likert scale is an example of an itemized rating scale because it rates response according
to a numerical value. For example one option, strongly agree, is valued at 5 and strongly disagree is
valued at 1, with other options valued in between at 2, 3, and 4. A constant-sum rating scale requires the
respondent to assign a value (e.g., percentage) to the options provided on the questionnaire. A paired
comparison scale asks respondents to make comparisons on the basis of specific circumstances or
criterion.

Unsatisfactory responses is low. Before a marketing researcher can analyze survey results, the raw data
must be converted into a usable format, which often involves assigning numerical values to the
responses. The researcher must review the raw data for errors, which occur when respondents do not
answer all of the questions. If the number of error-filled questionnaires is low, the marketing researcher
may decide to discard all questionnaires with errors. The number of or percentage of questionnaires that
a researcher discards due to errors depends on many factors; however, a generally accepted figure is
below 10 percent of all questionnaires that respondents fill out.

Tim did not answer the last two questions on a written survey. Response errors occur when respondents
do not correctly answer or complete a survey. These errors may affect the quality of the overall data and
the analysis process. Because Tim didn't answer two questions on a survey, a response error occurred.
Errors may be intentional or unintentional. For example, a respondent might refuse to answer a question
because s/he believes it is too personal, while another respondent might not answer a question because
s/he did not see it. Incorrect coding is an editing error. When a sample group is not representative of the
target market, a procedural error occurs. Developing open-ended survey questions does not indicate a
response error.

Internet survey. A survey is a marketing-research method that involves asking customers questions to
learn their opinions and the reasons behind those opinions. For example, a business might obtain
marketing information from its customers because it wants to determine their levels of satisfaction during
their last encounters with the business. The business might e-mail a short, easy survey to its customers
within 24 hours of their last business encounter. Because the survey is short and the encounter is fresh in
the customer's mind, the customer is more likely to respond to the survey. The Internet is a quick, easy,
cost-effective method for collecting this type of information. Face-to-face interviews and test marketing,
which are types of field experiments, are often expensive, time-consuming methods for collecting
marketing information.

demand for the business's product, the business may decide to reduce prices in order to generate more
sales. If a sales forecast predicts a drop in demand, a business would not increase production or recruit

Demand for skilled nursing care rises as the population ages. The impact of demographics (the age of
the population) on a specific industry (health care) shows that businesses have unique relationships with
their environments. The aging of the population affects other industries, but perhaps not as directly as it
does health care. An economy phasing through the business cycle and a shift in social/cultural attitudes
are examples of how environmental factors are dynamic. New technology causing new laws to be
enacted is an example of how environmental factors are interrelated.

Selecting vendors. Purchasing is the planning and procedures necessary to obtain goods and services
for use in the business or for resale. An important purchasing activity is selecting vendors (suppliers) that
have the products the business needs to use in its day-to-day operations, to make items to sell to
customers, or to resell to customers. Pricing is a marketing function. Developing financial statements is

Risk levels of doing business with the vendor. If a vendor is not financially stable, there is a risk that the

Making personal use of company property. Employees can help reduce expenses by respecting
company property. One way that employees can do this is by not taking anything belonging to the
business for their personal use. This can range from not making personal use of company vehicles to not
taking home pens and pencils. Businesses must replace the company property that employees take for
their own use, which results in additional expense for the business. Taking the initiative to find work,
reporting incidents of shoplifting, and giving appropriate discounts to customers are ways that employees
can help control expenses.

Accidents. An accident is an unexpected happening that may result in injury, loss, or damage.
Businesses reduce the possibility of accidents occurring by properly maintaining their facilities. Proper
maintenance helps to eliminate hazards such as torn carpeting, damaged floors, broken stairs, and
protruding counters. Accidents may occur at any time, but businesses can reduce the risk by properly
maintaining their physical facilities. A robbery is a theft that involves the use of force, violence, or fear. A
subsidy is government financial help given to a business. A takeover is an attempt by one business to

Objective. An employee who is objective tries to view conflict in an unbiased manner and is not

often are able to help solve the problem. By remaining objective, they are able to see both sides of the
conflict and identify possible solutions that will satisfy all concerned. Employees who are judgmental form
opinions before knowing all the facts. Employees who are emotional often make decisions based on their
feelings rather than on the facts. Employees who are aggressive often ignore the rights of others and
exploit them in order to achieve personal goals. Being judgmental, emotional, or aggressive often makes

Bait-and-switch advertising. This is an illegal tactic that involves promoting a low-priced item to attract
customers to whom the business then tries to sell a higher priced item. In many cases, the low-priced
item is in limited supply or completely unavailable when customers try to buy it. The business then shows
customers a more expensive item and encourages them to buy. A loss leader is a product that is sold
below cost. High-pressure selling involves putting pressure on customers to buy. Price-ticket switching is
a type of fraud by which a higher priced ticket is removed from merchandise and replaced by a lower
priced ticket.

No; it can delay entry into the full market. Test marketing involves introducing a product to a limited

marketing strategies. The product may be tried out in specific locations to get customers' and retailers'
reactions before starting a wider distribution. However, not all new products need test marketing. Test
marketing may not be used for some products/services because it is costly, delays entry into the full
market, provides no guarantee of actual success, may not give an accurate picture of performance, and
gives competitors an opportunity to steal the idea while it is being tested.

Provide replacement parts for the product. Businesses discontinue products for many reasons, such as
decreasing sales and profits. In other situations, the reason is because the business has developed an
altered version of the product or a new model. After deciding to discontinue the product, the business
must decide whether to provide replacement parts. In some situations, many of the discontinued products
remain in use in the marketplace. If replacement parts are available for purchase to fix the damaged
product, then an owner can still use the product. However, if parts are not available and the product
becomes unusable, then the owner may need to purchase another product, either the business's newer
model of the product or a similar product that one of the business's competitors offers. This often creates
an ethical dilemma because a very expensive, complex product, such as a piece of machinery, can be
very costly to owners to replace. Reducing the prices of discontinued products is a common practice and
is ethical if the business advises the buyer that the products are being discontinued. If there are a lot of
similar products readily available, then advising the public about other similar products on the market is
not necessary.

Each member possesses a unique perspective. When more than one person is involved in the creativethinking
process, different types of ideas are often generated because each member has a unique point

size, the quality and quantity of each member's contribution, and the situation requiring idea generation.
Therefore, it cannot be assumed that each group member contributes in the same manner, that ideas are

To compete effectively. The business with a deep product mix offers a great many items in the product

compete effectively. A shallow product mix helps a business to control its costs. The use of a narrow

Bundle. Product bundling involves combining several products and selling them for one all-inclusive
price. Businesses often bundle products to encourage customers to buy products that they might not
otherwise want to buy. The price of the bundled products is usually lower than the combined price of the
products sold separately. The lower price is an incentive to buy. As a result, customers buy the total
package, which may include products that they ordinarily would not purchase. Businesses routinely
promote, market, and display products. However, these activities usually are not very effective in
encouraging customers to buy products that they do not want.

Complementary and more or less equal in stature. Two brands join forces as "co-brands" for the purpose

works best when the two brands "go together," or are complementary, serve similar markets, and are
essentially equal. The co-branding arrangement of Starbucks and Barnes & Noble exemplifies cobranding
principles and has been extremely successful. Successful co-branding does not require that the

they be owned by the same parent company.

promotional activities other than advertising, personal selling, and publicity that communicate information

represent an example of direct advertising. Unless interactive capabilities are available, television is
usually considered a mass medium that has substantial reach but cannot always be measured
effectively. Therefore, the options referring to soft drinks and hotel chains are not examples of direct

Communications channels. A communications channel is a path or means used to provide information to

giving away advertising specialties, such as key chains that include the name and phone number of the
business. The reason for using these communications channels is to encourage customers to buy.
Samples, premium, and advertising specialties are not examples of publicity strategies, marketing

activities to communicate with the public and provide positive information. Creative thinking is

Most likely prospects. The target audience is a group of consumers who are the most likely prospects for
a good, service, image, or idea. As a rule, only those consumers who are interested in the products being
displayed will attend a particular trade show which is an event where businesses display and/or
demonstrate their products to build sales leads and interest. Therefore, participating in trade shows is an
effective way for businesses to communicate with the consumers who are the most likely prospects to
buy from the business. A business's major competitors usually participate in the same trade shows, but
the competitors are not the target audience. Trade shows often attract consumers from throughout the
country rather than only important local residents who may not be part of the target audience. Consumers
attending trade shows usually are not potential employees.

purchased items, such as bakery goods, do not need to prospect or qualify potential leads. Salespeople
who sell large, expensive items, such as cars, usually need to do a lot of prospecting and spend time
determining exactly what their customers want. Bakery customers usually know what they want, whereas
