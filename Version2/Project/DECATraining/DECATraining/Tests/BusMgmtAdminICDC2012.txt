a speaker's message. In the example, Jack is paraphrasing to verify his understanding of Wendi's
statement. Paraphrasing involves restating a message in other words to confirm the message recipient's

Present facts that support your point of view. Because others may have questions or concerns about
your idea, you should be prepared to defend those ideas by providing supporting information. By having
facts to support your idea, others are more likely to accept your idea and put it into action. Telling another
person that his/her opinion is illogical and refuting everything the other person says are not actions that
help you objectively and respectfully defend your idea. In fact, these actions may offend the other person.
Using dramatic gestures may indicate your enthusiasm about your idea but does not demonstrate why
your idea is good and should be implemented.

Active listening. To take meaningful notes, you must listen to what the speaker is saying. To pick up on
the key points, you must actively listen. Effective note-taking does not involve capturing every detail of
the presentation, nor does it involve the use of creative thinking techniques. And although it may be
helpful for some individuals, effective notes do not need to be formatted as an outline.

Describe the benefits to the audience. The primary goal of a persuasive message is to influence
behavior. Influencing others involves communicating benefits of taking action. The readers are more
likely to respond favorably to the message if they know how the action will impact or help them.
Communicating benefits is a central element to all types of persuasive messages. The beginning of the
message should catch the readers' attention and encourage them to read more. Depending on the type
of message, this might involve a quote. The message should be concise, so it should not contain
unimportant information. The message should be written to communicate the business's goals rather
than personal ones.

Recommending solutions. An analytical report involves examining opinions, facts, and data about an
issue, idea, or problem. Recommendations are placed at the end of the report after the issue has been
defined and all of the pertinent information has been presented. The introduction of the report should
define the problem. If research was conducted, the research techniques used are described in the

Cause and effect. Cause and effect reports provide information about a variety of scenarios under
different circumstances—if action A and B happens, then the probable result will be X. By developing a
cause and effect report, a business can analyze different situations and probable outcomes. The
business can consider the pros and cons of each scenario to determine which action will be best for the
business. An interpretive report provides the writer's perception of a specific topic. Individuals working in
the humanities and social-science fields often develop interpretive reports to clarify or interpret ancient
texts and complex cognitive concepts. Jury of executive opinion is a qualitative forecasting method that
gathers opinions from company executives. An argumentative report provides facts and data about two

Commitment to provide excellent service. A business's service orientation is its philosophy of a certain
level and quality of service. A business that is committed to providing excellent service should provide its
employees with adequate training about business's products, processes, and policies. When employees
understand the many facets of the business, they can often solve customers' problems more quickly
because they know what they need to do to correct the problems. When problems are solved quickly,
employees are indicating that they care about their customers, which leads to increased customer loyalty
and satisfaction. Solving problems quickly does not always involve bending company policies. Solving
customers' problems quickly does not demonstrate the employees' satisfaction level with the company's
products, nor does it demonstrate their ability to use upselling techniques.

Brand promise. The brand promise is a company's agreement (spoken or unspoken) with customers that
it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its brand characteristics and values. Strategies
are the activities the business uses to fulfill its brand promise and achieve its business objectives. Touch
points are all of the opportunities that a business has to connect with its customers and reinforce its
brand value. Disney uses many touch points to create “quality entertainment” experiences for its
customers through its theme parks, films, and television shows. Advertising is a form of promotion to
attract customers and reinforce the business's image or brand.

different types of customers, such as industrial customers and consumer customers. This divisional
structure is appropriate to use when selling goods to customers that build complex products and require
salespeople to understand industry jargon and concepts. The divisional structure by process has a
manager for each step in the production process and is often used by manufacturing companies. Multinational
corporations and retailers often divide a company by geographic region or territory. Unilateral
divisional structure is a fictitious term.

Demographic shifts. Immigration and globalization have lead to growing numbers of minorities in the U.S.

labels on their products and bilingual signs in their facilities. Lifestyle trends involve the shift in direction
regarding the way people live, socialize, and work. Family roles involve the function of members within
the family unit. For example, there are more fathers staying at home to take care of the children, while
the mothers work outside the home. Technology changes are always occurring and are not a primary

Transferring risk. Risk is the chance of loss. Businesses can transfer, prevent, retain, or avoid risk.
Transferring risk involves shifting the risk to someone else. In the example, the business is shifting risk to
the insurance company. In this situation, the insurance company will pay the business for its losses if a
hurricane or flooding damages the business. Retaining risk is keeping it. Reducing risk is preventing or
controlling it. Preventing risk is taking measures to reduce the risk. The business is not preventing
threats, retaining responsibility, or avoiding hazards.

Investment activity decreases. When interest rates increase, consumer and business spending tend to
decrease because the cost of buying on credit becomes more expensive. As a result, individuals and
businesses save rather than spend; the demand for credit tends to decrease; business profitability
declines due to reduced consumer spending; and businesses are less likely to invest their money and
expand business activities. When policies are implemented to control inflation, interest rates increase, the
money supply tightens, and lenders approve fewer loans. Therefore, the value of the dollar increases.

Overcommitment. It is important for workers to assess the time involved with a project before
volunteering to work on it. When workers volunteer to take on too many activities (overcommitment), they
often find that they do not have enough time to complete the projects thoroughly and correctly, which
affects the quality of their work. If project managers set reasonable deadlines, work quality is less likely to
suffer because team members have more time to ensure that they do their work correctly. Weekly status
meetings may improve work quality because the updates may identify problems that require corrective
action. Long-term goals do not tend to lead to lower performance quality in the workplace.

Problems are often resolved quickly. An aspect of managing knowledge involves making sure that
employees receive training and information about their specific jobs, products, relationships between

information to themselves. An unsatisfactory credit rating, uncooperative vendors, and poor customerservice

Staying organized. Employees can help their employers reach their objectives by working efficiently. To
work efficiently, employees should be organized and have a system for keeping track of their work and
supplies. Because Natalie's workspace was not organized, she spent a lot of time looking for a file
instead of working on something more productive. There is not enough information provided to determine
if Natalie has problems staying on task, using supplies wisely, or observing safety standards.

Nolo Legal Encyclopedia (www.nolo.com). Expertise and credibility are primary considerations when
evaluating the relevance of a source. Because regulations and legal procedures are important
considerations when setting up a corporation, Melissa should obtain information from a source that has
legal expertise, such as Nolo Legal Encyclopedia. The Wall Street Journal is a print and online business
publication that focuses on a wide variety of business and economic issues and trends. Because
Wikipedia is an open source of information that is constantly updated, some of the information might be
inaccurate or irrelevant. MarketWatch is a website that focuses on financial issues such as investing and
the stock market performance.

Vendor technical support. Comprehensive project-management software can help the project manager
allocate resources—human, financial, material, capital—in the most efficient ways. When selecting
software for complex, large-scale projects, it is important to consider the type of service support that the
software distributor is willing to provide. If problems occur, project managers and team members may
need to contact a technical support person to answer questions or to help solve technical problems.
Team members who have experience with different types of project-management software may offer
opinions, but the type of project, available resources, and constraints are likely to have a greater impact
on the project manager's selection decision. Legal business structure and budgeting methods are not
major considerations when selecting project-management software.

Resource allocation. Resource-allocation applications help project managers to allocate all the needed
resources—human, financial, equipment, supplies—in the most efficient ways. For example, the resource
allocation application can determine the skills that are needed to perform certain tasks. This, in turn,
helps the project manager identify appropriate team members to perform the work. Inventory
management software is used to monitor a business's merchandise and supplies. Scanning software
digitally captures documents and graphics to store on computers. Project managers use spreadsheet

Trends indicate an ongoing demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. Statistics are information presented
in numerical form. Businesses often interpret and analyze statistics to identify trends, which indicate the
general direction in which people or events are moving. If numerical data show that the sales for a hybrid,
environmentally-friendly car has been steadily increasing for several months, then the trend indicates that
there is an ongoing demand for the fuel-efficient vehicles. Hybrid (electric and gas fueled) cars are
environmentally friendly and fuel efficient because they use less gasoline than traditional vehicles. After
identifying the trend, the automaker might decide to reduce the production of luxury cars and increase the
production of hybrid cars, or increase its research and development budget to create more efficient cars.

Environmental regulations. If a business does not follow the jurisdiction's environmental laws, it risks
being shut down until it is in compliance. High emissions of toxic chemical in the air create pollution and
can negatively affect the natural environment and the health of people and animals. Building codes,
rather than construction codes, regulate the structure of facilities such as offices, factories, and homes to
ensure their safety. Administrative policies are internal guidelines for carrying out the business's work.
Estate laws regulate the distribution of a person's assets to his/her beneficiaries.

Local building codes. Building codes govern the construction and maintenance of a facility's structure.
Jurisdictions develop building codes to ensure that the facility meets a minimal set of standards to protect
the safety of facility's occupants and visitors. Electrical wiring, water lines, the grade of construction
materials, and the placement of the building's exits are types of things that building codes regulate and
monitor. A business that fails to meet building codes may be fined and closed until the problems are
fixed. Trade laws regulate the exchange of goods and services between jurisdictions (e.g.,
states/provinces, countries). Affirmative action is an effort to give special employment consideration to
disadvantaged groups. Electronic communication regulations govern the appropriate use of electronic
communication methods, such as telephone surveillance.

Trigger the fire alarm. A fire is an example of an emergency situation that employees should be prepared
to handle. One of the first procedures to follow if a fire is detected in the facility is to evacuate the
premises to protect the safety of employees and customers. To alert coworkers about a fire, Mandy
should trigger the fire alarm. The sound of the alarm will indicate that individuals should evacuate the
premises. Using a fire extinguisher may help put out or contain the fire, but does not alert others about
the fire. The fire department should be called after employees are alerted about the fire. Reciting the
escape route will not alert others to evacuate the building.

Use a password system. Businesses can limit employees' access to computer information by assigning
passwords to certain employees. For example, a company's accounting department typically works with
customers' financial records, so accounting-department employees are most likely to have authorization
to view financial data. On the other hand, the advertising department does not usually use customers'
financial information to carry out its activities, so advertising-department employees would not be given
passwords to access customers' financial information. Reviewing security policies and performing backup
procedures do not limit employees' access to certain business information. Debugging software corrects
errors (bugs) associated with specific computer software programs.

Consequences of not completing activities. By thinking about what may happen if a task is not
completed, you are evaluating the importance of the task, which helps you prioritize your work. For
example, suppose your manager needs a status report from you for a meeting that is scheduled two
hours from now. If you don't have the report ready on time, your manager will not have the information to
present during the meeting, which will make him/her unprepared. As a result, your manager is likely to
become upset with you. On the other hand, suppose you need to write a letter of recommendation for a
student who did an internship with your company. The student doesn't need the letter until next week. So,
if you don't write the letter today, it isn't going to cause a problem for your intern. The reason why your
manager delegated work to you is not important. Depending on the tasks involved, shortcuts are not
always an option and can often lead to unsatisfactory results. Long-term goals are objectives that will
take a year or more to reach. Daily work tasks are closely aligned with short-term rather than long-term
goals.

Duplicate work. Coordinating the work effort involves applying resources and tasks in ways that
accomplish the business's goals in the most efficient way. Coordination helps the business run smoothly.
An important aspect of work coordination is collaboration and open communication. Often, when team
leaders and team members do not collaborate and communicate effectively about how and when to do
the work, team members perform the work incorrectly or duplicate their efforts. In the example, Robert
told two team members to perform the same task, so the price list was updated twice. Duplicated work is
an inefficient use of resources because Todd could have completed another task while Sabrina updated
the price list. There is not enough information to determine if Sabrina and Todd calculated the new prices
accurately.

The necessary tasks. To coordinate work, you must know what tasks should be done, who should do
them, and the order in which they should be performed. It is important to communicate with each person
involved in the work effort so they know exactly the process and procedures they need to follow to
complete the work correctly. Technical changes are not always part of the work effort. High customer
satisfaction levels may result when the work is coordinated effectively. The business's requirements or
needs are considered when coordinating the work rather than the employees' requirements or needs.

It involves the coordination of multiple activities. A project is any type of task that has a distinct beginning
and end. Project management is the process of planning, scheduling, and monitoring the progress of a
project to achieve a specific goal. To achieve the project goal, the project manager must coordinate the
human and financial resources, equipment, and supplies to carry out the project's activities or tasks.
Projects can be simple or complex and do not always require a signed contract from stakeholders.

Computer programming flaws. Computer programming flaws (bugs) can cause problems when executing
and controlling various aspects of a project. Important data may be misplaced, left out, or transposed.
These errors can cause process delays, create financial and budgeting problems, and compromise
deadlines, which threaten the project's success. Developing and executing contingency plans can help
reduce the negative effects of potential threats. Effective security devices and the methods in which
budgets are developed are not threats to a project.

Weighted-point. There are many methods for businesses to use to evaluate their vendors' performance.
The weighted-point system involves assigning a numerical rating to evaluate various performance
categories. Although categories vary by business, they often include delivery and lead times, order
accuracy, order cycle, service levels, technology support, product quality, quality improvement, and
costs. The rating scale may range from one to five—one representing "poor performance" and five
representing "excellent performance." By assigning a numerical value to various areas of performance,
the business can evaluate the vendor's strengths and weaknesses and determine if improvements
should be made. The cost-based system focuses on product and delivery costs. Applied-tabulation and
cycle-oriented are not methods used to evaluate a vendor's performance.

Ongoing communication. Ongoing communication is necessary to build trust, respect, and a mutually
beneficial partnership which, in turn, helps build a long-term business relationship. The amount of lead
time depends on the nature of the product and cannot always be flexible. Policies that are too rigid may
have negative effects on the relationship rather than positive effects. Autocratic management involves a
dictatorial leadership style in which the leader determines all policies, maintains close control, and lets
employees know only what they need to know to do the job.

To replenish its regularly-stocked items. A straight reorder is a purchase order in which the business
orders normally-stocked items to replenish items that have been used or sold. Orders that are placed to
accommodate customers' unique requests are special orders. A modified rebuy is a type of order in
which there are changes in the quantities or styles of items that are routinely ordered. Seasonal
merchandise includes items the businesses order and sell during specific times of the year when demand
is high. Large retailers often use blanket orders to purchase seasonal goods (e.g., holiday gift-giving
season).

Item to be purchased is new and complex. It is not always necessary to negotiate terms face-to-face,
which can be time-consuming and expensive. However, there are occasions in which face-to-face
negotiations are desirable, such as when the business is purchasing a new item that is complex and
expensive. Complex items may require the vendor to provide training and support, so the business may
want to meet with the vendor to negotiate these types of details. If the expectations are clear among all
parties, the costs and risks associated with the purchase are low, or the relationship is not important to
either party, negotiations do not usually need to take place in face-to-face meetings.

Monitor quality consistency. Quality control involves ensuring the degree of excellence of a good or
service. Most businesses use some type of quality control method to achieve their standards of
excellence and minimize errors. The quality control methods used depend on the type of business and
work that is being produced. Manufacturing companies often inspect random items as they come off the
production line to ensure that the items meet their quality standards. If all the inspected items meet the
established standards, the products' quality levels are consistent. Random product inspections do not
improve product value, achieve sales goals, or assess employees' ideas.

Systematic process. Quality assurance is a process that businesses use to prevent defective products
from being created, not just to eliminate or correct them after they have already been produced. Quality
assurance involves developing and executing processes in a methodical (systematic) way to ensure that
the business creates products that meet its product standards. Product innovation is a part of the
product-development process. Classifying information is an information-management activity. The need
for supplier input depends on the type of product and the nature of the business's relationship with the
supplier.

Customization. Product quality is affected by many factors. Customization involves making a product to
meet a customer's specific needs and wants. Because each item is unique, the perception of quality
differs. In the example, a customer may request that the artisan make a plate in a specific size using
specific colors. Mass production is the rapid production of large quantities of goods. The example does
not provide enough information to determine if the artisan has the production equipment to mass produce
customized ceramic items or if the items are durable and safe.

It involves change throughout the entire organization. Six Sigma is an internationally recognized quality
management framework that was developed by Motorola. Six Sigma focuses on continuously improving
quality throughout an organization while lowering its costs at the same time. An important aspect of using
the Six Sigma framework is continuously setting incremental goals and measuring their success against
the established benchmarks. To implement and execute Six Sigma successfully, improvement efforts
should involve input and action from employees at all levels of the organization. When all employees are
involved in the process, they often feel as if they have control over their work, which can increase
personal job-satisfaction levels.

Value stream mapping. To facilitate continuous improvement, some businesses use value stream
mapping to plot all activities and information in the flow of production. Developed by Toyota, the valuestream
map is a visual depiction of the entire production process and is used to help the business identify
bottlenecks and inefficiencies. As inefficiencies are identified, the business can take action to improve
processes. The 80/20 rule is a selling principle which states that 80% of a business's sales are made by
20% of its customers. A fishbone diagram is a visualization tool that helps the business find ways to solve
a problem by focusing on the possible reasons for the problem. Reverse audit is not a visualization tool
that businesses use to observe production flow.

Insurance company did not explain all of the policy's exclusions to the store. It is unethical for an
insurance company to place obscure, complex exclusions in an insurance policy without explaining them
to the policyholder. Insurance policies can be very difficult to understand, so the insurance company
should explain important information so the policyholder understands what the policy covers. The
policyholder can reduce or manage its risk by reviewing the contract carefully (or having a lawyer review)
before signing it. The insurance company can reduce the risk of policyholders filing lawsuits by explaining
the policy's terms clearly. If the store owner did not pay the insurance premium on time, the policy
lapsed, and the insurance company is not obligated to pay for damages. When the insurance policy was
purchased is not an ethical issue in relation to the situation. The insurance policy would not cover
workers' compensation. Workers' compensation covers employees who are injured on the job.

Fraud detection. To reduce the risk of internal theft, businesses often use fraud detection software. Fraud
detection software can detect problems relating to issues, such as policy violations, embezzlement, and
suspicious social networking activity, in real time. Firewalls secure a business's computer network from
unauthorized external users. Malware is an illegal form of technology designed to disrupt computer
systems. Antivirus software is designed to protect computers from malware.

File a lawsuit against the store for negligent behavior. The legal principle of duty to care states that
individuals and businesses are morally obligated to be cautious and behave in ways that are not harmful
to others. A business that does not take steps to ensure that its facilities are safe tends to run a higher
risk of financial loss, as well as a damaged reputation. In the example, the store's unintentional
negligence is a breach of duty because the wet floor caused injury to a customer. The store may
experience financial losses to cover the customer's medical expenses, legal expenses, and other
compensatory damages. The store's risk of financial loss decreases if Mrs. Talbot's insurance company
pays her medical expenses. The hardware store was acting carelessly rather than deceptively. Disability
payments made by Mrs. Talbot's employer are not a risk for the store.

Preventative. Businesses must comply with a variety of government regulations. Because regulations
often change, it is important for businesses to keep up with changes so they can implement appropriate
action, if needed, to stay in compliance. Monitoring regulations is a preventative action because it is
taking steps to prevent the negative consequences associated with noncompliance. If a business does
not comply with regulations, it can be fined, or in some situations, closed down. In addition,
noncompliance may result in a poor public image that lowers the business's credibility with its customers.
Corrective, reactive, and remedial actions are taken after issues or problems are identified.

Maximize resource efficiency. Planning is the management function of deciding what will be done and
how it will be accomplished. Effective planning helps the business to determine how to allocate all of its
resources—human, financial, equipment—in the most efficient and cost-effective ways. Businesses are
more likely to achieve their goals when they plan, but planning does not guarantee positive results.
Planning does not necessarily improve interpersonal relationships, nor does it influence employees'
adaptability.

Reduces uncertainly. Planning is the management function of deciding what needs done and how it will
be accomplished. Planning is a futuristic process, which means that managers are forced to think ahead
about needed resources, risks, and desired outcomes. Thinking ahead or planning reduces uncertainty
because managers are evaluating various scenarios to determine the best way to achieve goals.
Planning may reduce errors but does not eliminate them. Delegating work is an organizing activity, which
involves assigning authority or responsibility for something to another person. Planning does not lessen
the need to monitor employees, which is a controlling activity.

Organizing. The organizing function of management focuses on setting up the way the business's work
will be done. Organizing involves determining what resources the business needs and how the various
resources will work together to accomplish the business's goals in the most efficient ways. Staffing is the
management function of finding workers for the business. Directing is the management function of
providing guidance to workers and work projects. Controlling is the management function that monitors
the work effort.

Structure. The organizing function of management focuses on setting up the way the business's work will
be done. Organizing provides the business with structure—a systematic, orderly way for carrying out
activities to accomplish the business's goals. Insight can help managers develop the best structure for
the business. Leverage refers to the amount of power one person holds during a negotiation. Motivation
is directing activity.

Screening. Staffing is the management function of finding workers for the business. Staffing is an
important function because employees do the work to accomplish the business's goals. Screening is a
staffing activity that involves reviewing employment applications to determine which applicants have the
skills that best fit the business's needs. Orienting is the process of familiarizing a new employee with the
company. Training involves providing information or teaching skills that the employee needs to perform
his/her job. Innovating is the process of generating unique ideas or products.

It helps clarify the employee's role in the business. Directing is the management function of providing
guidance to workers and work projects. By providing guidance, managers are clarifying the employees'
roles in accomplishing the business's goals. Although the business is more likely to achieve its goals if
coworkers are willing to collaborate and maintain positive working relationships, directing is primarily
focused on making sure that employees understand and carry out their responsibilities. Setting goals and
defining the business's purpose and vision are planning activities.

Managerial control. Control is the management function that monitors the work effort. To determine if
employees or processes are working effectively and efficiently, managers must set standards by which
they can measure the success of an employee's performance or the quality of a product. By comparing
standards with performance (outputs) the manager can detect problems and determine if and how
changes should be made to correct the problems. The example is not providing constructive criticism,
internal feedback, or remedial action.
