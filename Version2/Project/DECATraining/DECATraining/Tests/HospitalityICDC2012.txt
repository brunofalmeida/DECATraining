on the business's property to ensure that the business compensates the customer for her/his injuries.
The business doesn't want to take on the debt; instead, the court determines that the business owes the
customer money and requires the business to pay the debt. The lien is an involuntary debt for the
business.

Intrusive personal searches. Air transportation is regulated by specific government agencies. Airports and
airlines are required to abide by regulations concerning safety, routes, passenger rights, etc. Due to an
increased concern about terrorism, airports have increased their security measures to reduce the risk of
potential terrorists accessing airplanes as passengers. These measures include luggage and clothing
inspections, pat downs, and body scanners to detect weapons that a person might have. Some travelers
feel violated by the use of these techniques, and in the United States, some people believe the searches
violate the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment—the right to be secure of unreasonable searches and
seizures. Some people may be annoyed with passport purchasing procedures, airline overbooking
practices, and baggage fees; however, these issues do not relate directly to airport security.

Clear communication. Businesses coordinate channel management with their promotional activities to
make sure that sufficient quantities of products are available when they are needed for an advertised
sale. If a business plans to promote a certain product or offer it at a special price, the business must
make sure that an adequate supply will be on hand to meet consumer demand. Therefore, it is important
for the business to clearly communicate with its channel intermediaries and its internal departments (e.g.,
purchasing, advertising, sales) to ensure that the product arrives where and when it is needed to satisfy
customers. Activity reports and selling policies are not required to ensure that products are available
where and when they are need for a sales promotion.

Government publications. Regardless of whether you are writing a report, preparing for a debate, or
simply learning something new for the fun of it, identifying and reading sources that provide relevant,
valid information about the subject at hand is very important. If you don't use relevant, valid information,
you may write, say, or learn something that is misleading or untrue. A number of criteria are commonly
used to determine if certain written materials are relevant and valid. These criteria include the author's
credibility, the date of publication, the publisher, etc. For instance, if you are researching federal
legislation such as copyright law, you are most likely to read relevant, valid information in government
publications. The government writes and enforces copyright law and other federal legislation, so
government publications about these laws are most likely to be timely, accurate, complete, and on topic.
People commonly express their opinions, not facts, in online discussion forums. Search engines are
software programs that automatically crawl the Web looking for information pertaining to specified search
terms and display a list of results. The search engines themselves do not contain information about
federal legislation; they direct you to other web sites—some good and some not so good—about federal
legislation such as copyright law. Political blogs typically reflect the opinions of their writers, so their
information may or may not be relevant or valid.

Actively listen to the question. To provide a legitimate, effective response to an inquiry, you should
actively listen to the question. Rather than rehearsing your response in your head while the question is
still being asked, you should listen carefully to the inquiry. By actively listening to what is being said, you
are more likely to understand the question and answer it appropriately. If you still don't understand the
inquiry after actively listening to it, ask for clarification. When you are certain that you understand the
intent of the question, pause for a moment to consider your response. Don't respond immediately or say
the first thing that pops into your mind. Instead, compose your response silently and then say it aloud. It
is not necessary to make your answer as long as possible. Your answer should be concise, containing
only the information necessary to completely and specifically respond to the inquiry. Avoid answering a
question with a question because it gives listeners the impression that you are trying to evade responding
to the inquiry.

Deductive. Information can be organized and ordered in many different ways, including deductively,
chronologically, geographically, and by value. However, in the business world, most information is

Less significant information such as examples and reasons are presented later in the report. Zeke would
be wise to provide his recommendations for incorporating social-media promotional strategies first and
following his recommendations with specific examples of how these strategies could be used by the

information in order based on the geographic location of items. When organizing information by value, a
writer presents topics in order of numerical value or size.

Quantitative primary data are costly to obtain. The writing process typically involves several steps: prewriting,
drafting, revising, editing, and publishing. During the editing step, the writer or copyreader should
review what has been written to determine if it meets certain criteria to be published and/or shared with
others. These criteria include proper sentence structure, appropriate grammar and punctuation, correct
spelling, etc. “Quantitative primary data are costly to obtain” is the only statement that is properly
structured, contains appropriate grammar and punctuation, and is spelled correctly. (The word “data” is
the plural of “datum”.) The word “quota” is singular, so “Roger's weekly sales-volume quota are $8,500”
contains an incorrect verb. (The verb should be “is,” not “are”.) In the statement “Carole is developing a
prodect analysis sheet”, the word “prodect” is spelled incorrectly. (The correct spelling is “product”.) The
phrase “Frank, Gus, and Bob” is a plural subject, so the wrong verb is used in the predicate of the
sentence. (The verb should be “are” instead of “is”.)

characteristics and values. By delivering on their company's brand promise, employees can reinforce the
company's positive image among customers. These employees become brand ambassadors,
communicating the company's vision, mission, and brand through their actions and words, both on the
job and off. Developing a broad product/service mix does not necessarily reinforce the company's

Wide. Many factors affect how many employees a manager can effectively supervise, which is the

can usually perform their work without a lot of supervision. If employees require less supervision, the
manager can usually handle more employees at once, which means the manager has a wide span of
control. When employees need a lot of guidance and supervision to perform their work, it takes more of
the manager's time. In these situations, the manager tends to have a narrow span of control. Intensive

Lower occupancy rates. During an economic recession, consumers and businesses spend less money.
When spending decreases, fewer people travel for leisure or business purposes, which results in unsold
hotel rooms. When hotel rooms are not sold, the facilities' occupancy rates decrease. When occupancy
rates decrease, hotels tend to lay off employees to lower their labor costs, which results in an increase in
the unemployment rate in the community. To reduce the risk of business closure and further economic
turmoil, governments do not usually increase property taxes during a recession.

Progressive. Gary favors a progressive tax structure. A progressive tax structure is one in which those
who earn more are required to pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. In other words, as the
income increases, the tax rate also increases. The U.S. income tax is a progressive tax. If using a
regressive tax structure, people who earn more income pay a lower percentage of income in taxes. As
income increases, the tax rate decreases. Sales and excise taxes are considered to be regressive taxes,
because people with lower incomes ultimately pay a larger percentage of their income in sales and
excise taxes. A proportional tax structure is one in which everyone pays the same percentage of income
in taxes, regardless of income level. Few taxes are completely proportional in nature. Exclusive is not a
type of tax structure.

The money supply. Although inflation has the potential to occur whenever aggregate market demand
increases or aggregate market supply decreases, long-term inflation is ultimately caused by significant,
persistent increases in the money supply. In other words, there must be a significant increase in the

consumer purchasing power and diminishing returns do not cause inflation. Instead, consumer
purchasing power decreases as a result of inflation. Diminishing returns are not closely related to

Floating. An exchange rate is a specification of how much two currencies (such as the U.S. dollar and the

exchange market with no government intervention. A fixed exchange rate is established and maintained
at a specific level by the government. A pegged exchange rate is similar to a fixed one-government

Empathetic behavior. Successful hotel managers should be able to effectively communicate with guests,

ability to put yourself in another person's place. In the example, Miranda put herself in Mr. Wilson's place
by telling him that a leaky faucet would annoy her, too. She expressed that she could relate to Mr.
Wilson's feelings. Miranda was being empathetic. Because Miranda was able to respond to Mr. Wilson's
problem, she was actively listening rather than passively listening. The situation does not provide enough
information to determine if Miranda was exhibiting cultural sensitivity. Personal vision is the future that
you desire to create for yourself.

Extinction. Extinction is the act of withholding reinforcement in order to change a behavior. Essentially, it

better, like pigging out on junk food. That would be like rewarding yourself for bad behavior. By soothing
his hurt feelings with junk food, Jonathan is setting himself up to lose control again in the future, just so

healthful, practical ways to avoid these things. The reward technique involves rewarding yourself with
something you like if you are pleased with your self-control. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in
another person's place. Jonathan is not practicing stimulus control, the reward technique, or empathy.

Due diligence. Prior to making an acquisition decision, most companies conduct an investigation or
examination of the potential acquisition target. Companies conducting due diligence typically do so to
determine how to structure the acquisition and how much money to pay for the acquisition. When
conducting legal due diligence, a company analyzes its target's compliance with legal obligations and
requirements. Doing so helps the company to determine how much risk is involved in acquiring the target
business. Companies do not conduct legal segmentation, legal credit rating, or legal leveraging during

similarities and differences. A credit rating is the score assigned to a borrower based on previous loans.

Determine if it should enter another market. Hospitality and tourism businesses collect marketing

There is not enough information provided to determine if the chain's sales have decreased. Businesses
use a SWOT analysis to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The chain will
likely evaluate its potential competitors to determine the feasibility of an expansion; however, the
information that the chain is currently collecting does not contain information about competitors.

Primary. Primary research involves gathering, recording, and analyzing new information specifically for
the purpose at hand. The tour company collected feedback for a specific purpose, which was to
determine satisfaction levels with the company's tour products; therefore, the tour company has collected
primary research. Secondary research is information that has already been collected for other purposes.
Unilateral and bilateral are types of contracts rather than types of marketing research.

Check-in dates. By setting the appropriate query in the facility's guest database, the bed and breakfast
inn can obtain the desired information quickly. In the situation described, the inn wants a list of guests
who stayed on the property for a specific time frame. By setting a search by check-in dates (June 1, 2011
- September 30, 2011) in the guest database, the inn can quickly obtain a list of guests who stayed on
the property during the desired time period. The inn can use the list to generate mailing labels or obtain
e-mail addresses to send promotional messages to those guests. The inn's room numbers, as well as the
guests' mailing address and phone numbers, would not provide the inn with the desired information in an
efficient way.

Web-log analysis. A hospitality business can determine such things as queries, entry pages, exit pages,
bounces, paths through the site, file types, and virtual domains by using web-log analysis software. The
web-log software provides statistics that reveal how many people visited the web site, what they did while
there, how long they stayed, and where they went when they left the web site. Automated-reservation
software allows guests/customers to reserve hotel and tour products by telephone or Internet without the
aid of an employee. Multimedia software allows users to create and play audio and video files. Projectmanagement
software is used to plan, schedule, monitor, and evaluate the various resources and
activities for a project.

Sales history. By reviewing previous years' sales reports, a resort can detect patterns in the sales, which
are tied to the resort's occupancy rates. If a pattern emerges, such as an increase in sales between May
and July over several years, the resort can determine its busiest time of the year—its peak season.
Determining the peak season helps the resort plan (e.g., staffing) the upcoming year. The current
occupancy rate will not help the resort determine its peak season unless it is compared to previous sales
in the same time frame. Staff reviews are employee performance evaluations. Standards are
specifications or statements that are used as a basis for comparing or judging goods or services. Staff
reviews and standards are not reliable sources of information that resorts use to determine the resort's
peak season.

The executive summary highlights the most important points of the research report. An executive
summary is the section of a research report that highlights the most important information that appears in
the body of the entire document. The purpose of the executive summary is to provide an overview of the
entire report because many businesspeople do not have the time to read the entire document. The
inclusion of recommendations in the executive summary depends on the nature of the research report
and the intended audience. The executive summary is often the last component of the report that is

Positive guest experiences. Hospitality and tourism businesses market their products to individuals who
participate in producing and experiencing the services. The goal for hospitality and tourism marketers is
to create circumstances that facilitate positive experiences for their guests. When guests have positive
experiences, they are more likely to become repeat guests or visitors. And, satisfied guests are more
likely to recommend the businesses to others. Product-mix decisions, pricing decisions (inexpensive vs.
expensive), and interaction standards are set in relation to a business's specific organizational goals.

Obsolete. Records can be either paper or digital. Paper records are stored in drawers, in cabinets, or on

Random access memory. Random access memory (RAM) is the computer's short-term memory
responsible for storing information needed by software applications that are currently in use. The number
of applications that a computer can run at once depends a great deal on the amount of RAM that the
computer has. A computer with a lot of RAM can run several applications at once, while a computer with
little RAM can run a much more limited number of programs at the same time. The central processing
unit (CPU) is the brains of the computer—it performs calculations and tasks that allow software to
function properly. The hard disk drive (HDD) is the computer's long-term memory where more permanent
information is stored. A web-hosting service is an Internet service provider (ISP) that keeps businesses'
web pages up and running for a fee.

an intranet, much of today's groupware is Internet-based, allowing group members in multiple locations to
work together online. Many Web 2.0 tools such as Google Apps are groupware applications. Shareware
is essentially sample software. It gives consumers an opportunity to try software free-of-charge before
purchasing it. Because it is merely a sample, the shareware is likely to be limited in functionality or time.
Spyware is malicious software installed on computers to gather users' personal information. Freeware is
software available at no cost to consumers.

not lower maintenance problems, security needs, or billing errors.

Intermediaries. Intermediaries are channel members operating between the producer and the consumer
that aid in the movement of goods and services. Today, most lodging facilities maintain web sites that
have capabilities which allow guests to book their reservations via computer. Internet advancements
have reduced the need to book hotel accommodations through travel agents and other travel
intermediaries. Intranets are internal computer networks that allow users to access information and
communicate with others within an organization. A subsidiary is a company that is entirely controlled by a
parent company. Amenities are additional goods and services that make the primary hospitality product
more attractive (e.g., dry-cleaning service, wake-up calls). Booking hotel reservations directly with the
hotel property has not reduced the use of intranets, subsidiaries, and amenities.

project planning to ensure that the project's scope is clearly defined. This entails developing a Work
Breakdown Structure, identifying needed human and nonhuman resources, developing a project
schedule, and preparing a project plan. The execution, or implementation, stage requires the project
manager to monitor and control project activities by maintaining ongoing communication with all project
participants, updating and modifying the project plan, monitoring risks, controlling project quality, gaining
change approvals, and maintaining project records. The closure stage entails writing final project reports

Performance indicators. A performance indicator is a measure of the success of a certain activity or
entity. Businesses often set performance indicators for their own success, as well as the success and
effectiveness of their suppliers. Performance indicators commonly used to evaluate vendor performance
and effectiveness include on-time delivery rate, return rate, and number of customer complaints. If a
vendor does not meet or exceed a particular indicator, the business is apt to discuss the measure with
the vendor and develop a plan of corrective action. A consensus scale is a measure of each group
member's feelings toward a proposed decision or solution. Economic indicators are statistical measures
used to assess the health and direction of the economy. Return on capital is a measure of how well a
business generates cash flow in relation to the capital it has already invested into itself.

Contact the supplier to resolve the discrepancy. Businesses monitor and track their suppliers' invoices to
make sure they are billed correctly. If the business finds a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect discount amount)
on the invoice, the business should contact the supplier to make necessary adjustments. In many
situations, the supplier will send the business a revised invoice with the correct information. By paying an
invoice that is higher than stated in the original purchase order, Kara is tying up funds that the business
can use for other things. If the supplier does not take steps to correct the invoicing error, it might be
appropriate to send a complaint to the supply company's president; however, Kara should begin the
process by contacting the appropriate supply-company employee (e.g., salesperson). The supplier needs
to generate a corrected invoice, not the business itself.

identifying new, different ways to position a product or a company. LXT capitalized on positioning

Price lining. Price lining is the practice of selling goods/services at a limited number of predetermined
price points, or levels. In the example, the car-rental company prices each category (line) of vehicle at a
minimum price point—the better the class of car, the more expensive the rental. The bundle pricing
strategy involves combining one or more related products and selling them for one all-inclusive price. The
price of the bundled products is usually lower than the combined price of the products sold separately.
Loss-leader pricing occurs when businesses sell products below cost. Even pricing involves the use of an
even number at the end of a price to suggest high quality. In the example, all of the prices indicated end
with a five, which is an odd number.

product may have features that competing products do not have. By focusing on these unique features,
the business is positioning the product on the basis of its attributes or physical characteristics. Positioning
on the basis of price is related to the product's value. Prestige positioning involves focusing on status

subtotal ($179.36 + $53.70 + $22.50 + $78.60 + $71.61 + $71.58 = $477.35). Next, multiply the subtotal
by the discount percentage amount to obtain the dollar amount of the discount ($477.35 X .05 or 5% =
$23.8675 or $23.87). Finally, subtract the discount dollar amount from the subtotal to obtain the purchase
order total with the discount ($477.35 - $23.87 = $453.48).

6. Stock turnover is the number of times stock is sold in a specific time frame. The formula for calculating
stock turnover is the number of yellow T-shirts sold divided by the average number of yellow T-shirts in
stock. In this situation, the resort gift shop sells 750 yellow T-shirts a year and keeps an average of 125
yellow T-shirts in stock (750 ÷ 125 = 6).

Product extension. A product extension is an additional product related to, but different than, the main
product. In the example, Fun-Tastic's primary product is a form of entertainment—an amusement park
with rides and shows. A water park is also a form of entertainment, but differs from an amusement park
because it involves water and swimming activities. A merger occurs when two individual businesses
combine to form one organization. Product positioning refers to the consumer's image or impression of a
product as compared to that of competitive products. A joint venture is an arrangement that involves two
or more businesses entering into a relationship by combining complementary resources such as
technology, skills, capital, or distribution channels for the benefit of all parties. A joint-venture relationship
is usually short-term or for a single project/transaction.

Fabric samples. Vendors will often provide samples of products so that buyers can see, touch, and
inspect the products firsthand. In the situation provided, the resort's purchasing manager wants to see
the available colors and quality of the linen's fabric. The vendor may provide small samples or swatches
of the fabric to help the resort's purchasing manager make a buying decision. A testimonial is a
statement by an identified user of a product proclaiming the benefits received from the use of the product.
A warranty is a promise made by the seller to the buyer that the seller will repair or replace a product that
does not perform as expected. Testimonials and warranties may facilitate the buying decision; however,
these options do not allow buyers (purchasing managers) to inspect products firsthand. When a desired
item is not available, a vendor may suggest a substitute item that is similar to the item originally
requested. A buyer may want to inspect a substitute product before purchasing it; however, there is not
enough information provided to indicate that the purchasing manager is requesting samples of a
substitute product.

Using key words in URLs. Search engine optimization is the process of designing and submitting web
pages so that they can be found easily by spiders to obtain a good position in the search results. URL is
an acronym for uniform resource locator, which is the web site's address. Placing key words related to
the content in the web site's URL may improve the web site's rank or placement in the search results.
Anchor text is the text that is used in a hyperlink. Anchor text should also include content-related key
words (rather than unrelated jargon) to improve position or rank in search-engine results. The use of
underscores between key words may hinder a good position in the search-engine results. Cascading
style sheets refer to the formats and elements (e.g., font size, color, layout) used to develop a web page.

Customer evangelist. A customer evangelist is a very loyal product user who encourages others to try the
product. The customer evangelist actively seeks up-to-date information about the product, brand, or
business, and passes that information on to his/her social network. Businesses understand the
importance of the evangelists' efforts and use a variety of strategies to provide them with information to
pass on to others. In the example, Jane discusses the resort with members of her social community and
actively seeks information about the resort. Therefore, Jane is a customer evangelist. Early adopters are
individuals who are the first to purchase or try a new product. Trend setters are individuals who influence
the direction in which people and events are moving. There is not enough information provided about
Jane to know if she is an early adopter of products, a trend setter, or paid to promote the resort.

Word-of-mouth marketing. Word-of-mouth marketing is a form of publicity that occurs when customers
tell others of their satisfaction with a business and its products. Celebrities who engage in word-of-mouth
marketing have a lot of influence over others because they have an extremely large fan base. Oprah
Winfrey yields a lot of influence and power due to the success of her long-running talk show. When her
show was in production, businesses sent their products to her television studio. The businesses wanted
Oprah to try their products and include them on her annual "favorite things" episode, which attracted an
extremely large television audience. The situation provided is not an example of sponsorship activities,
online-advertising strategies, or customized communication. A sponsorship is an agreement that allows a

messages that are designed to appeal to each message recipient. The television show is a form of mass
communication rather than customized communication.

Gaining the readers' attention. The purpose of direct-marketing copy is to persuade the reader to take
action. ADIA—attention, desire, interest, action—is an acronym for a technique commonly used to write
persuasive messages. The first step is to gain the reader's attention. If the first part of the message does
not gain the reader's attention, the reader probably will not finish reading the message. The next step is
to generate interest and explain the relevance of the message. The third step is to create a desire to take
the necessary action. During this step, the writer often describes the benefit of the action or product.
Finally, the writer urges the reader to take action and explains how to do it, such as providing a toll-free
number to place an order. The writer cannot assess the readers' interests or address all of the possible
objections the audience might have.

Create a sense of urgency. Internet advertising copy should encourage the reader to take action—to buy

Web surfers tend to scan Internet content quickly, they are likely to ignore an ad that contains too much

Sponsoring a charitable event to raise funds for the area's hospital. Being involved in community
activities can facilitate positive publicity for a business. Positive publicity is likely to create or reinforce a
favorable image of the business with members of the local community. Supporting a controversial issue
is likely to generate some negative publicity for the business. Launching an advertising campaign to
introduce a new logo and developing a feature story for the employee newsletter are not activities that
affect the well-being of the community. Therefore, those activities are less likely to generate a favorable
image than sponsoring a charitable event that does affect the community.

Coupon-redemption rate. Hospitality and tourism businesses use a variety of metrics to measure the
performance of their promotions. Coupons are a form of sales promotion. A riverboat tour company can
evaluate the effectiveness of its coupon sales promotion by calculating the number of redeemed coupons
from a specific publication in relation the publication's reach, which is the coupon-redemption rate,
expressed as a percentage. If the redemption rate is low in relation to the ad-placement costs, the
business may decide that it isn't worthwhile to advertise or place coupons in the publication in the future.
A rebate is a return of part of the price a customer pays for a good or service, which is usually offered by
the product's manufacturer. The riverboat tour company is not determining its market share in relation to
its competitors. The click-through rate measures the number of times that web-site visitors click on an
online advertisement on the Internet that automatically transports the visitors to the advertiser's web
page. The business is not evaluating Internet activity.

Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Showing videos of the Myrtle Beach golf courses and resort properties
relates to the product being promoted. Placing a golf bag and other golf-related merchandise next to the

schedule is not an important factor when selecting appropriate cruises to present to him/her. Providing
