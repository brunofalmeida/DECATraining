governmental agencies. The legislative branch of the government (i.e., U.S. Congress and Canadian
Parliament at the Federal level) establishes these agencies, which have the authority to enact and
enforce regulations for various administrative functions, including aviation, taxation, and commerce. For
example, in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates air-transportation
functions (i.e., airspace, aircraft safety); the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) handles issues related to
personal and business taxes; and the Federal Commerce Commission (FCC) handles issues related to
business and commerce. The legislative branch of government introduces and passes statutes. The
judicial branch of government (court systems) interprets the law. The executive branch of the government
guides government policy, and in some countries, has the power to veto legislation.

Follow the written directions in the proper sequence. The first step in applying written directions to
perform tasks usually involves reading the directions. Employees need to understand the written
directions before they can apply them. If employees do not read the directions and apply them in the
proper sequence, they may perform the tasks incorrectly. Therefore, reading the directions for
understanding and meaning is an important step. The use of shortcuts to complete a task may or may not
be included in the manual’s written directions.

Applauding. When the audience applauds or claps, it is showing that it supports what the speaker is
saying. Applause encourages the speaker to continue expressing his/her thoughts. Heckling or making
fun of someone is an action that indicates disapproval. When people ignore the speaker, they are not
actively listening to the speaker and not indicating their support. If a person tolerates another individual's
opinion, s/he does not necessarily agree with an opinion, but supports the individual's right to express
that opinion.

Empathetic. Being empathic is acting according to an intellectual identification with the thoughts, feelings,
values, attitudes, and/or actions of another person. It is often helpful to imagine yourself in your friend's
place, to try to understand how s/he feels. By doing so, you often gain insight and can better help your
friend by providing thoughtful advice. If you are too formal, judgmental, or businesslike with a friend, you
may come across as uncaring, and you may offend your friend.

The data are too complex to describe in the body of the text. Tables present text or numbers in a grid
format. The table allows readers to see groups of data together for comparison. Tables are also useful
because they summarize data in an easy to read format. Tables present data (e.g., statistics) that may be
too wordy or complex to describe in a paragraph format. Tables should appear in a document where they
are most appropriate, which may be the body, conclusions, recommendations, or appendices. The
inclusion of a bibliography is not a factor when determining if a table should be included in the document.
The primary purpose of tables is to provide information, which may or may not build credibility and

Recommendations. An analytical report is a document that explains and evaluates an issue, opportunity,
or problem. A component of the analytical report is the recommendations section, which provides the
reader with advice for resolving a problem or acting on an opportunity. The recommendations appear at
the end of the report after background information, research, results, and facts have been presented.
Writers should include logical arguments for analytical reports in which the topic is controversial, and the
audience may disagree with some of the report's information. By providing logical arguments, the writer is
more likely to persuade the audience to accept the conclusions. An analytical report may address
external factors or the progress of an action, but including this type of information depends on the nature
of the report's topic.

potential merger by summarizing information in an analytical report. Reports that address financial issues
associated with a certain course of action, such as a merger, are called due diligence reports. A market
analysis summarizes information about a segment of the population. Troubleshooting analyses provide
guidance for solving problems with a product or process. A justification report provides information that
supports or justifies a previous course of action.

Patient, flexible and empathetic. So that businesspeople don't do something that will offend their clients,
they should adapt their communication styles with clients from different cultures. To develop positive
relationships with international clients, businesspeople should try to learn as much as they can about
their clients' cultures, customs, and social values. Adapting communication styles requires
businesspeople to be patient, flexible, empathetic, respectful, confident (but not overly so), honest
(transparent), and sensitive to their clients' cultures and customs. Projecting biased, demanding,
manipulative, or indifferent attitudes may offend the clients.

production-line conveyer belt is a high cost, long-lasting item that manufacturers use in the production of
goods and services. Parts are industrial goods that become part of a finished good without additional
processing (e.g., bolt). Staple goods are frequently purchased goods that businesses keep on hand
continuously because the demand for them is constant. As an intangible product, a service is an activity
that is performed by others for money.

Small, close. Control is an aspect of the management function that involves monitoring the work effort.
The manager's span of control is the range of employees who report to the manager. If a manager has
few employees to supervise, then s/he has a small span of control, which allows more time to closely
monitor the employees. If the span of control is large or broad, then the manager has several employees
to supervise, which limits the amount of time that the manager has to monitor the employees' activities. A
large span of control works best when the employees are familiar with their jobs, and they work well
independently.

Conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists when a situation presents an opportunity for personal gain,
but compromises the best interests of the overall business. For example, if a buyer accepts an expensive
gift from a prospective vendor, and then provides the vendor with a sizable order or a long-term contract,
a conflict of interest may exist. Many businesses implement policies that address potential conflicts of
interest. For example, a business may implement a zero-tolerance gift policy, which involves
reprimanding employees who accept or receive gifts. Exhibiting responsible behavior and showing
concern for customers are ethical actions.

Increases, increase. Interest is the reward or cost of lending or borrowing money, and this amount is
usually figured as a percentage of the amount of money borrowed. The interest rate is the percentage
figure used to calculate interest. Many factors affect interest rates, including government policies and the
business cycle. The nation's rate of inflation, which is how quickly prices are rising in the marketplace,
can affect interest rates. When the inflation rate increases rapidly, the interest rates also increase. This
occurs because there is less money available for financial institutions to loan to individuals and
businesses. When the inflation rate levels off, prices tend to stabilize, and in some situations, prices may
decrease.

Gift-giving is often discouraged because it may be viewed as bribery. Gift-giving practices vary greatly

the United States, many businesses limit or prohibit gift giving/receiving because it may be viewed as
bribery, which is an illegal activity under certain circumstances. American businesspeople do not expect

courteous to call him/her professor without the person's surname. An architect is greeted as "Arquitecto,"
and an engineer is greeted as "Ingeniero." Men without professional titles are addressed as "Don"
followed by their first names, and women without professional titles are addressed as "Dona" followed by
their first names. It is not customary to greet Costa Ricans by using their full names. Senora is the

break a business deal. On the other hand, some cultures view the concept of time differently. A
businessperson might keep a client waiting because s/he wants to finish a task so that the client has
his/her undivided attention. Therefore, it is important to understand how foreign businesspeople view the

Managing work commitments in a timely manner involves allowing enough time to complete the most
important tasks first. Joe had commitments that he needs to keep from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and at 2:00
p.m. Because the vendor asked Joe to meet at a restaurant that was 30 minutes away from his office, he
doesn't have enough time to meet with the vendor for one hour at 1:00 p.m. If the vendor is not available
at an earlier time at a closer location, Joe must decline the luncheon invitation and schedule it at a time
that is more convenient for both of them. It's not unusual for last-minute meetings to take place, if other
commitments are not an issue. Therefore, the vendor was not being rude by asking Joe if he had time to

Plan your work in advance. Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension.
Ongoing stress can have a negative effect on an individual's productivity. People who procrastinate tend
to place additional stress on themselves and others because they do not provide enough time to
complete the work to the best of their abilities. As a result, work efforts are rushed, mistakes are made,
conflicts occur, and the work quality is compromised. One way to reduce this source of stress to is plan
your work well in advance. By doing so, you can leave enough time to address unexpected situations and
complete quality work with fewer mistakes. Taking short breaks throughout the day, maintaining a healthy
diet, exercising, and getting enough sleep are other ways that can help you effectively respond to stress.
However, taking breaks every hour will reduce productivity. Personal tasks should be completed before

is understandable to the intended audience. Governments do not regulate the ways in which businesses
report financial data to reduce taxes or stimulate market growth. The consequences of incorrect
information (e.g., fines) may reduce the risk of mistakes on the report, but the risk of mistakes cannot be
eliminated.

Censorship. Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a
common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an
extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any
cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another
member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin
to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the "good of the group."
Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do. In
today's competitive business environment, the pressure to earn high profits has often resulted in
fraudulent behavior, embezzlement, money laundering, etc. Such actions are often a result of groupthink
conditions. Empathy is the ability to place oneself in another person's place or circumstances. Empathy is
not a characteristic of groupthink, which embraces harmonious or like-minded thinking.

Orientation sessions. An orientation program makes new employees feel welcome, gives them a general
overview of the business, and helps to motivate them to do their best. Orientation sessions often include
activities such as reviewing general company policies and compensation, describing training programs,
providing a tour of the facilities, and introducing the new employees to their coworkers. Performance
evaluations, application screenings, and financial seminars are not activities that help new employees
become familiar with their new business environment.

Explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is knowledge or information consisting of words, numbers, codes,
processes, and formulas that are easily stored, shared, and quantified (measured). The president of the

Low efficiency. Tacit knowledge is knowledge consisting of personal opinions, experiences, expertise, or
understanding that is not easily articulated, stored, or quantified. Tacit knowledge is often acquired by
trial and error, which occurs by repeating tasks and activities over time. When an employee devises
effective shortcuts or techniques that increase personal productivity, the employee has tacit knowledge.
When employees are unwilling to share tacit knowledge that will improve efficiency levels, it takes longer
for the company to achieve its goals. Employees who share tacit knowledge may improve the business's
efficiency and create a more open and cohesive work environment, which will reduce the
competitiveness among employees.

Inevitable disclosure. The concept of inevitable disclosure suggests that workers are likely to intentionally
or unintentionally share their current employers' trade secrets with future employers. Although most
jurisdictions have regulations that acknowledge and protect trade secrets, the treatment of inevitable
disclosure cases varies. Some jurisdictions do not support non-compete clauses as a way to limit tradesecret
disclosure because these types of agreements inhibit a worker's right to seek employment. These
jurisdictions view the sharing of knowledge as an inevitable occurrence, which may occur unintentionally.
The situation does not illustrate limited confidentially, competitive obstruction, or trade-character
infringement.

Relational database. A relational database contains various types of data that are organized in tables. By
setting a query, the categories of information can be linked together in a variety of combinations to obtain
the desired output. The categories might contain data such as the customers' names, addresses, phone
numbers, order dates, payment dates, etc. For example, a business might want to know which customers
have overdue accounts within a certain time frame, such as 60 days. By setting a query, the business
can retrieve the data in a report, which it can use to follow up with the customers. The same database
may also contain sales information. The sales manager can set a query to obtain the names of the
customers who have ordered a certain dollar-volume range (e.g., $5,000 - $10,000) within a certain
period (e.g., September 1, 2009 - December 31, 2009). The sales manager can use the data to prepare
forecasts, analyze customer buying habits, etc. Newsletters, instruction manuals, and microfilm are not
technological tools that a business can use to store, update, and access various types of information

Protect its trade secrets. A nondisclosure agreement is a contract between an employer and an
employee that states that the employee will not reveal the employer's trade secrets (e.g., formula, recipe,
manufacturing technique) to future employers for whom the employee might work. Nondisclosure
agreements provide the business legal recourse if a competitor attempts to use the information for
financial gain or benefit. Businesses do not ask their employees to sign a nondisclosure agreement to
avoid discrimination lawsuits, ensure their employees' privacy, or prevent copyright infringement.
Copyright infringement involves the unauthorized use of written or artistic works.

Hierarchical information. A hierarchy arrangement sets information in a certain order, rank, or level. The
laddering technique is a tool that helps an organization to capture information and categorize it into a
meaningful and useful order. The business can obtain information by collecting tacit knowledge from
internal and external sources. The laddering technique, which can be implemented manually or with a
computer program, can help a business organize the steps necessary to complete a certain activity or
process. By doing so, the business might discover ways in which it can change the ordering system to
increase efficiency, such as eliminating an unnecessary task or a task that is being performed twice.
Horizontal communication occurs among individuals at the same level, such as coworkers.

Request for proposal. Complex projects often require the expertise of external resources. Building a new
facility requires skills from architects, construction companies, electricians, etc. And because these types
of projects are expensive, companies want to obtain bids from the potential vendors or contractors to
determine which one is best suited to perform the work. A request for proposal (RFP) is an invitation for
potential vendors to present bids to obtain a contract and perform the work. Because the work is
complex, the RFP must include specific information and provide detailed instructions about the way the
proposal should be written. Often, an RFP will require potential vendors to provide a summary of
qualifications as a section of the proposal. A business plan is a company's blueprint for success—its
business model. An executive summary is an element of a business plan and provides and overview of
the most important information.

False. It is unethical to distribute customers' personal information without their permission to third parties.
Businesses collect and maintain information about their customers, employees, products, and vendors.
Governments require businesses to maintain certain types of information to be in compliance. Some
information, such as customer credit-card account numbers and health information, are confidential, so
the business should take steps to secure the information. Distributing customer information (e.g., mailing
lists) without their consent to third parties is not ethical behavior and is illegal in many jurisdictions. Trade
agreements are agreements between nations that provide for favorable trade relations. Trade
agreements do not allow businesses to sell customers' personal information. Antitrust laws are
regulations that prevent a person or company from taking actions that restrain free trade and competition

to obtain a lot of product information from a central location at their convenience. Many web sites have
employees who answer customers' questions in real time through chat-room and text-messaging
capabilities. High definition television (HDTV) and satellite radio are forms of media that communicate
information; however, they are expensive forms of media, and are limited in scope, depth of information,
and interactivity. Scanners are electronic tools that transmit paper copies of text and graphics into a

Corporate-level. Large businesses often have many projects occurring at the same time. In some
situations, different projects need to access the same data. Corporate-level project-management
software is a powerful tool because it provides the ability to track hundreds of tasks and several projects
at one time. Corporate-level project-management software typically provides cost accounting, resource
leveling, "what-if" analyses, charting, and reporting capabilities. Some corporate-level software programs
allow businesses to select other software options to accommodate their specific needs. Single-project
programs are used for individual (single) projects. Scheduling software has fewer options than corporatelevel
programs, and contains primarily scheduling, Gnatt charts, and presentation capabilities. Costing is
a software capability rather than a type of project-management software program.

Easier to manage. It is easier to manage vendor relationships when a company works with a small group
of vendors. When the company works with fewer vendors, it has more time to cultivate long-term
relationships with each vendor. Long-term relationships benefit both the company and the vendor
because both businesses are willing to share information; are understanding of each other's needs,
expectations, and limitations; and are more willing to work together to resolve conflicts that might occur.
Working with a few vendors does not always provide the business with a wider product selection. A
disadvantage to working with a few vendors is that supply interruptions are more likely to affect the
company because it may not have easy access to another source that sells similar goods or services.

Have employees compete for the position of quality inspector. Creating a culture of quality involves
asking all employees to be responsible for quality. Using quality inspectors moves the responsibility for
quality away from each employee and onto the inspector. The remaining answers could be used to
involve employees in improving quality. When employees identify internal customers, they recognize that
these customers need to receive good quality work from them in order to do their job. Empowering
employees to “stop the line” to fix a defect stops defective parts from continuing through the
manufacturing process. Quality-focused teams encourage employees to work together to improve quality.

Detect trends. Business analysis is the process of investigating and evaluating a business issue,
problem, process, or approach. Businesses analyze financial data to evaluate the financial well-being of
their operations at any given time. By comparing the same type of financial information from different
consecutive time periods, a business can detect trends. By detecting trends, the business can determine
if it needs to make changes. For example, if the business notices a substantial increase in sales-dollar
volume over a three-month period, trends indicate an increase in spending. The business may decide to
conduct further analysis to determine what customers are purchasing, and decide if it needs to increase
the production or inventory-levels of certain products. Businesses analyze markets for many reasons, but
they cannot control market activity. To analyze its competitors, a business needs to obtain and review
external data. Comparing internal financial data cannot influence buying behavior.

After her supervisor ends the call, ask her to clarify the instructions. It is always best to get clarification
straight from the source of the information. Most supervisors will appreciate an employee who knows how
to collect facts and then do a job well instead of an employee who guesses and then wastes time
completing the wrong thing. Asking a coworker may lead to an incorrect guess as well. Proceeding
without clarification may lead to time and effort wasted. Working on something else means that Tonia

Yes, it is important to learn about many careers before selecting one. Even if Laney thinks she knows
what she wants to do, she may find she has interests in careers she didn't even know existed. Career
exploration will allow Laney to make an informed decision that may or may not result in becoming a
singer. Learning about careers and pursuing her dreams are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Career
exploration is simply research into careers, interests, and aptitudes. What she does with the research is

Board of directors. A corporation is a form of business ownership that is owned by stockholders who
have purchased units or shares of the company. Corporations are governed by a board of directors,
which consists of people, sometimes shareholders, who make decisions about the business's activities.
The corporation's CEO directs the executive staff (e.g., chief financial officer, vice president of
operations) to execute these decisions. Therefore, the CEO reports to the board of directors. The CEO is
expected to follow government regulations, but does not report to regulatory agencies.

that no package should take less than eight hours or more than 80 hours to complete. This rule intends to

Technical. Effective project managers possess basic technical skills. Although many project managers
don't perform the technical tasks that the team members do, they still need to understand the technical
aspects of the project to answer questions, give directions, and solve problems. Interpersonal skills

ability to influence others' opinions or actions. Negotiation is the ability to reach an agreement with

A customer complains that her/his new cell-phone battery quit working after one week. Quality
management is the coordination of resources to ensure the degree of excellence of a process, good, or
service. If customers complain that goods are breaking or not working after a short period of time (e.g.,
cell phone batteries), there may be a product-durability problem. After a problem is detected, the
business can determine why the problem is occurring and then take steps to fix the problem, which will
restore or improve the quality of the product. Returning a sweater that is a wrong size, complaining about
the way a steak has been prepared, and returning a software package because it does not work with a

Lower costs. Quality management involves the coordination of resources to ensure the degree of

continuously setting higher goals of perfection. The Six Sigma framework builds upon previous goals to
set higher goals in order to continuously improve the quality of the business's goods, services, or
processes. The ultimate goal is to maximize outputs, have no process or product defects, and minimize
production costs. Therefore, an important aspect of the Six Sigma philosophy is to continuously lower
costs while improving quality. When quality improves, customer satisfaction tends to improve. To
continuously improve, the business may determine that it needs to simplify activities, obtain better
technology, or reevaluate its needs.

Higher demand. Continuous improvement is an ongoing process that looks for ways to increase the
levels of excellence in relation to a process, good, or service. Potential benefits of improved processes
often increase the business's productivity levels. Increased productivity levels result in increased outputs,
lower costs, and increased revenue. When quality improves, customer satisfaction levels often increase,
which often results in a higher demand for the business's goods and services. A premium is an item that
a business offers to the purchasers of a particular product. Offering premiums to customers and

Businesses that provide ethics-training programs can reduce the business's level of risk. By providing an
ethics training program, the business can advise its employees about its expectations in relation to
workplace behavior. Because an employee's personal ethics may differ from the organization's ethics, it
is important for the employees to have a clear understanding of the business's expectations. When
employees don't have a clear understanding of the business's expectations, they put the business at risk.
Businesses cannot assume that employees know their expectations. Employees who do not follow the
business's ethics guidelines may cross a legal line without knowing they have done so. If employees
cross ethical lines and break the law, the business may experience fines and obtain unfavorable publicity.
Management sets the tone for ethical behavior, so it is important that managers set a good example for
employees by exhibiting a high standard of ethics. By behaving ethically, the business can protect its
reputation with customers, vendors, and the community.

Passwords. Businesses must take precautions to secure their confidential information. To reduce the
risk of unauthorized access to confidential information, businesses often assign computer passwords to
allow authorized employees to view secured information. This reduces the risk of confidential information
getting into the wrong hands. Encryption, rather than decryption is a way to protect information.
Encryption is the process of transforming information into a secret code so that unauthorized users are
not able to read it. Groupware applications are software programs that allow several computer users to
access the same information from different locations. Spooling is the process of transferring computer
data to a temporary location so the data can be retrieved and processed through a different computer
program.
