Protect natural resources. The primary purpose of environmental regulations is to protect natural resources, including the air, soil, and water. Environmental laws require businesses to control the amount and type of pollution they release into the environment and to use appropriate measures for the disposal of hazardous waste. By following environmental regulations, businesses are complying with the government's efforts to protect natural resources by keeping air, soil, and water safe for consumption. Antitrust laws prevent monopolies, which are conditions that reduce competition in the marketplace. Encouraging business development and safeguarding business structures are not the primary purpose of environmental laws.

Exclusive dealing. Exclusive dealing is illegal when it hinders a competitive environment. In the example, the business holds a big part of the travel/tourism market, and is attempting to keep members of its distribution channel from selling competing travel products. This keeps other businesses from entering or competing in the marketplace, which is unfair, particularly to small businesses. Tying agreements are illegal agreements that require a customer to buy other products in order to obtain the desired goods and services. Selective distribution is a business strategy in which a producer sells products through several, but not all, wholesalers and/or retailers. Channel control refers to the level of authority that each member has in the distribution channel.

Coercion. Coercion is an attempt to gain compliance through threats or by bullying. When a channel leader places unreasonable pressure on a channel member to do something that is not in the best interest of the channel member, it is using coercion. For example, a channel leader that yields a lot of power in the distribution chain may set unrealistic sales goals for a dealer, or it may pressure a supplier to lower its prices to a point that it hurts the supplier's profits. Coercion tends to create channel conflict, leads to unfair and unsatisfactory business relationships, and often disrupts the distribution process. Control is a management function that monitors the work effort. Deception is misleading behavior. Diplomacy is tact.

Selective distribution strategy. A business that uses a selective channel strategy uses a few, but not all, available wholesalers and retailers to distribute its products. The business selects the channel members by considering their capabilities (e.g., order size, promotion) and their willingness to work with the business. The intensive distribution strategy distributes products through as many channels as possible. A traditional channel system is one in which the channel members are more concerned with achieving their own goals than they are working as a team to move products and satisfy the end user. Directional marketing system is a fictitious term.

Standards. Standards are specifications or statements that are used as a basis for comparing or judging goods and services. Businesses (e.g., cruise lines) establish standards as a way to measure and evaluate their channel members' performance levels. If a channel member is performing below the standard a business has set, the business may work with the channel member to improve its performance or decide to terminate the relationship. Collateral is anything of value belonging to the borrower that is pledged to a lender to guarantee that a loan will be repaid. Predictions are estimations or forecasts. Incentives are things that will fulfill certain desires. A business does not use collateral, predictions, or incentives to evaluate how its channel members are currently performing.

Take time to plan the steps needed to meet the task objective. Travel-agency supervisors need to think through the task to the point that the steps in the task are clear in his/her mind. This will lead to clear communication of the directions. Asking for feedback occurs after the directions have been given to ensure the employee understands his/her task. In most cases, it is counterproductive for a travel-agency supervisor to complete the task before asking the employee to do it. Once the task is done, there is no need to ask someone else repeat the work. Warning an employee that directions will not be repeated could lead to the task being done incorrectly if the employee didn't understand the instructions. In addition, it is disrespectful to speak to a colleague in the manner one might speak to a child.

9:30 a.m. Travel agents and airline employees often need to explain the differences in time zones to clients. Because clients often travel to destinations that are located in different time zones, they will need to know how to adapt their activities in relation to the time differences. To determine the aircraft's arrival time to Denver, add three hours to Montreal's departure time, which is 11:30 a.m. Then, subtract two hours from 11:30 a.m. to obtain the arrival time in Denver's time zone, which is 9:30 a.m.

Client retention rates. When travel-agency managers direct employees in ways that promote goodwill, they are guiding the employees' attitudes and actions so they will satisfy clients and build client loyalty. Loyal clients generate repeat business and improve the travel agency's customer retention rates. Channel members are the intermediaries that move goods and services to the end user. An investment involves using money to generate a profit or gain. Resources are the items or people that are needed to complete a project.

Collective bargaining. Collective bargaining is the process by which unions and employers negotiate new contracts, vacations being one of the mandatory issues negotiated. Salting is the process of unions paying workers to apply at certain companies so that the union can begin organizing those workers. Conciliation is used when bargaining reaches a stalemate, and a third party is called in to keep negotiations going between the union and employer. Unionization is the multi-step process by which unions are formed.

Depression. In an economic depression, consumers often choose to save their incomes due to uncertainty about the future. Many of them also lose their jobs, so there is more incentive to save than to spend. In a period of economic expansion, consumers spend more and save less because they are optimistic about the future. During times of economic recession, consumers are inclined to save more and spend less; however, it is for a shorter time period than an economic depression. In an economic recovery, consumers begin to spend again because there is optimism about the future of the economy.

Local ordinances. In business, a subculture consists of workers that exhibit characteristics that differentiate themselves from the rest of the organization's culture. Many factors can affect the subculture. Location of the business can be a strong factor, such as subcultures at different facilities of a company. The relative jobs of the different employees can lead to bonding over shared tasks and problems, also creating a subculture. Professional background, such as shared experiences at a different company or shared educational experiences, are also strong factors in the creation of subcultures. Local ordinances are laws or regulations that govern a town or city. Local ordinances are not factors that influence the subcultures of an organization.

More employment opportunities. When the number of visitors increases the demand for goods and services, this tends to create jobs and employment opportunities. For example, to accommodate more visitors, additional hotels and restaurants may be built in or around the community. These facilities need workers to clean and maintain the facilities and prepare food. This has a positive effect on the community's economy because it employs people and adds to the gross domestic product. High inflation rates often have a negative effect on tourist destinations because people cannot afford to travel. The level of government regulation varies by community, so increases in travel tourism may increase or decrease government regulation.

Conflict is unavoidable but manageable. A conflict is a disagreement. Every one of us disagrees with another person at some point. Therefore, conflict is unavoidable. Although people cannot avoid conflict, they can learn to effectively manage it. That is, they can appropriately handle their thoughts, words, and actions when a conflict occurs. Functional conflict is a disagreement that is tangible or concrete. Dysfunctional conflict, rather than functional conflict, is negative and destructive because one or both parties use inappropriate words and actions when addressing the issue. Emotional conflict is a disagreement that is based on differences about personal beliefs, values, or experiences. Emotional conflicts are not always easily resolved. A conflict must be acknowledged before it can be resolved.

Increased group cooperation. Team building involves developing skills and attitudes of support and collaboration among employees and management to accomplish company goals and objectives. The purpose of team-building activities is to build trust, respect, openness, and honesty among the team members. When team members feel comfortable with one another, the team becomes more cooperative; the team members increase their effectiveness in working together to accomplish their goals. When a team works together (cooperates), the team's negotiating and problem-solving skills usually improve. Team cooperation also improves the quality of feedback and creates an environment in which all members can provide leadership based on their unique skills. Autocratic leadership does not promote a team-oriented effort. Autocratic leadership is a dictatorial leadership style in which one leader determines all policies, maintains close control, and lets employees know only what they need to know in order to do the job.

Emotional intelligence. A leader is an individual with the ability to guide or direct others in a desired manner to achieve goals. Although leadership styles vary, effective leaders tend to exhibit several common characteristics, one of which is a high level of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and manage your own emotions as well as those of others. This means that you are aware of your emotions, respond to them appropriately, and then do the same with the emotions of others. Shared vision is the ability to share a vision (e.g., better way of doing things) and use it to inspire others. Responsibility involves taking ownership of a problem, making sure it is fixed, and taking steps to prevent it from happening again. When a leader exhibits integrity, s/he adheres to an established set of personal ethics and sound moral principles in all situations.

Tactful. A coach is a person who enables others to reach their true potential by helping them overcome the barriers that are keeping them from doing so. An important aspect of effective coaching is providing feedback to the coachees. This involves letting the coachees know what they did right, what they did wrong, and how they can improve. Effective coaches do this by being tactful—by not being harsh or negative when they provide feedback. The feedback does not need to be creative, but it should be specific and encouraging. Providing feedback in an aggressive way would probably have a negative effect on the coachee, making him/her feel defensive.

Provides a sense of identity and stability. Organizational culture is the standards, rituals, attitudes, and belief systems that create the workplace environment and influence the interactions within it. When managers and employees embrace and adopt these standards, rituals, and attitudes, they create a group identity—a sense of belonging to and working for something bigger than oneself. When this happens, employees often experience a sense of stability. This means that they know what to expect and what is expected of them when they arrive at work each day. When employees feel a sense of identity and stability, they are often more creative and productive, which helps the travel agency achieve its goals. Fringe benefits are the "extras" (e.g., discounts) that a travel agency offers its employees. Offering fringe benefits is one of many ways to reinforce a positive organizational culture, but is not always something a travel agency provides. Rewarding a few employees often creates a negative work environment. Standardized processes exist in any type of organizational culture—positive or negative.

A theme park provides strollers and wagons for visitors who have small children. Different types of customers often have special needs, such as families with young children. To accommodate families with young children, theme parks often provide strollers and wagons for their use.

Offering discounted admission tickets to a target market is an example of a pricing strategy. An airline's offering beverages to passengers is an example of a product/service management option.

Revenue reports. Travel and tourism businesses use daily revenue reports to analyze income from all of its revenue or income sources. For example, a tourist attraction, such as a museum, might sell admission tickets, sell goods in the gift shop, and sell food at concessions. The daily revenue report captures all of the money that each division makes during operating hours. The report might indicate areas that are not profitable for the museum, which can help the museum determine where it needs to make changes or improvements. Status summaries, debit statements, and allowance folios will not provide travel and tourism businesses with complete information about their sources of income.

A travel agency sends its clients' payments for a bus tour to the tour operator. When working with large tour groups, travel agencies usually collect payment from their clients (tourists), and then pay the tour operator (supplier). The method to transfer funds depends on the arrangement between the travel agency and the tour operator. The travel agency may write a check and mail the funds to the tour operator; it may use various forms and vouchers (e.g. miscellaneous charges orders) to transfer funds; or it may have the funds electronically transferred from the agency's financial account to tour operator's account. Mr. Jacobson is an example of a consumer purchasing a service directly from the service provider. A client asking questions and a tour guide presenting an itinerary are not examples of a travel/tourism business transferring payments to suppliers.

Judging an employee on the basis of work performance. Ethics are the basic principles that govern your behavior and involve acting in ways that distinguish right from wrong. In human resources management, ethics involve doing what is right by treating all employees fairly. Being fair involves judging each employee solely on the basis of his/her work performance. This includes providing equal opportunities, being unbiased, and avoiding favoritism. Promoting an employee on the basis of friendship might be viewed as unethical behavior because the promotion is based on a personal relationship or favoritism rather than job qualifications and performance. Hiring an applicant on the basis of gender and interviewing an applicant on the basis of appearance are unethical and often illegal because these actions exhibit bias.

Have the desired skills to perform a specific job. It isn't feasible for travel agencies to interview every person who submits a resume for a job opening. Therefore, travel agencies screen resumes, which is the process of reviewing resumes to determine which candidates have the qualifications to perform the job. For example, if a job requires a worker to type 50 words a minute, and the applicant's resume indicates that s/he types 70 words a minute, then the applicant would meet the travel agency's criteria for performing one aspect of the job at an efficient level. A resume is a document and doesn't adequately provide insight or enough information about the applicant's ability to improve a skill, his/her ethics, organizational skills, and efficiency levels.

Change or disable the employee's computer passwords. Travel agencies dismiss or fire employees for a variety of reasons, including poor work performance or serious company policy violations. Employees' reactions to dismissal vary, but they may become angry about the situation; therefore, the travel agency must take precautions to secure other employees and its information from vengeful acts. Security measures often include having an authorized staff member escort the dismissed employee from the building, obtaining business property from the dismissed employee (e.g., keys), and changing the dismissed employee's computer passwords to prevent further access to the travel agency's information. For these reasons, a travel agency should never inform employees of their terminations by telephone. Compensation issues are addressed during the termination interview.

Popular products. A travel agency that monitors its sales and clients' buying habits over time can determine which travel products (e.g., cruises, destinations, tours) are popular and which travel products are not selling. By knowing which travel products are moving well and not so well, the travel agency can make informed decisions about its product mix. For example, a travel agency may decide to offer popular travel products with new or additional tour options. Research methods are the ways in which a business obtains marketing information. Economic resources are the human and natural resources and capital goods used to produce goods and services. Monitoring its sales and its clients' buying habits will not help the travel agency identify research methods, economic resources, or competitors' activities.

If the target market consists of schools that offer trips for their students, then the tour company would develop tours that are educationally-based, such as a tour of the nation's capital, historical sites, or museums. Some tours involve short-distance travel and some involve long-distance travel, depending on the departure location and the destination. Tours should consist of fun activities and should provide an opportunity for learning. However, requesting the tourists to participate in complex activities may bore or frustrate them.

Demographics. Age, ethnicity, and income are all factors of the science of demographics, which studies the various aspects of a group's background to determine similarities in decision making of individuals within groups. Sometimes, geographical areas are used to segment populations. This type of targeting can emphasize attachment to a particular geographic location as the defining feature of a group. Behavioral segmentation sorts consumers based on their attitudes towards or use of a product or service. Psychographics is used to segment markets on the basis of beliefs, values, attitudes, lifestyles, etc.

Mass. Mass marketing is a strategy in which a business offers one option to the entire segment without considering the market segments' differences. Instead, the business focuses on the common needs of the consumers, and it designs its marketing activities in a way that appeals to the whole market. Concentrated marketing is a strategy in which a business appeals to one or a few small markets with the goal of developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Niche marketing is a form of concentrated marketing that involves tailoring its efforts to appeal to a very narrow market segment. Isolated marketing is a fictitious term.

Marketing. Marketing planning provides an overview of how a rental-car company will reach its strategic goals. This overview is called a marketing plan. It contains analysis of the market, marketing objectives, marketing strategies, and how the strategies should be implemented based on the analysis and objectives. Strategic planning sets the goals of the company as a whole without reference to how the goals should be accomplished. Objective planning is a fictitious term. Operational planning focuses on the day-to-day execution of the marketing plan. It does not explain the goals of the marketing plan or the basis for the steps outlined within the marketing plan.

Conducts a market analysis. A market analysis is a systematic study of the market. It is important for a bus-tour company to know how many members of the market want the bus-tour company's travel products before it spends the money to market the product in that area. If there is little or no demand for the travel product in a specific geographical area or region, then it is not practical to spend money to offer and promote the travel product. A bus-tour company does not use a market analysis to evaluate its technology needs or to develop financial standards. The purpose of an orientation program is to introduce new employees to their coworkers and orient them to their new work environment.

Competitive intelligence. A cruise line conducts a competitive analysis to find out what its competitors are doing. It involves obtaining competitors' product and pricing information from a variety of sources that are available to the general public—customers, web sites, advertisements, etc. This type of information is commonly called competitive intelligence. After obtaining the information, the cruise line can evaluate its competitors' strengths and weaknesses. The competitive analysis helps the cruise line make its own marketing decisions. For example, a cruise line might find that its competitors have not tapped into a certain market. If feasible, the cruise line might develop a plan to target that market to increase its overall market share. Adversarial information is a fictitious term. Causal research is marketing research that focuses on cause and effect and tests "what if" theories.

Product. A marketing objective is a specific, measurable goal or desired outcome. Businesses (e.g., airlines) set many types of marketing objectives, such as sales, promotion, profit, distribution, and product. When a business states that it wants to improve its service by a specific increment, it is setting a product-oriented marketing objective. A business's promotional objectives are the goals associated with promotion, which is the marketing function that communicates information about products, images, or ideas to customers or clients.

$761,153.75. The marketing budget is an estimate of marketing income and expenses for a specific timeframe. When businesses set their marketing budgets, they must consider many factors. If an economic downswing is occurring, the Curtis Tour Company may be losing sales, which reduces the amount of income the business has available to pay for its marketing activities. When less income is available, businesses tend to reduce their marketing expenses. To calculate the Curtis Tour Company's new budget amount, first subtract the reduction percentage from 100% to obtain the percentage amount left for the upcoming year's marketing budget (100% - 15% = 85%). Then, multiply the last year's budget amount in dollars by the percentage amount for the upcoming year's marketing budget ($895,475 x 85% or .85 = $761,153.75).

The strengths and weaknesses of its marketing strategies.  A marketing audit provides evaluative information about a travel business's marketing strategies. The ultimate goal of the marketing audit is to identify how well its marketing strategies are performing, which involves identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the travel business's marketing activities. By identifying the weaknesses and problems associated with the marketing strategies, the travel business can make changes to improve performance. Although a marketing audit might reveal financial problems, it does not provide a travel business with an action plan to improve its financial situation, nor does it provide specific information about its intermediaries' profits. An environmental scan would indicate external issues affecting the travel business, such as regulation changes.

Technology improvements. A trend is the general direction in which people or events are moving. To compete in the marketplace, travel and tourism businesses must use technology. Technology can improve a business's efficiency and productivity levels by making use of technological tools, such as machinery, computer networks, and the media. Because technology is always changing, travel and tourism businesses must also change to remain competitive. Economic conditions (e.g., unemployment rates, inflation, interest rates, business growth) fluctuate and change and do not remain stable. Business and consumer buying motives are not always predictable. Product classification is not a business trend that affects a business's efficiency and productivity levels.

Fewer accidents. Safety policies are the travel agency's rules or guidelines for keeping employees free from danger, risk, or injury. Travel agencies establish safety policies to protect employees from circumstances that have the potential to cause bodily harm, such as accidents. Employees who follow safety policies are less likely to experience workplace injuries that result from accidents. A travel agency that has a history of few or no accidents often saves money because it pays lower insurance rates (premiums). The travel agency's safety policies do not always affect the travel agency's employee turnover rates. All businesses are mandated to follow a variety of safety regulations, which is one reason why they develop their safety policies.

Control costs. When a travel agency monitors it supply usage, it is making sure that the employees who are using the supplies are using them appropriately. When supplies are wasted or used inefficiently, it costs the travel agency money to obtain additional supplies. Therefore, a travel agency that develops requisition procedures for employees to obtain supplies and monitors supply usage is taking steps to control costs. A travel agency that monitors supply usage is not improving sales, maximizing service, or maintaining demand for products.

To determine the optimal selling price for a good or service. A break-even analysis is an assessment that identifies various levels of sales that a cruise line needs to achieve to reach the break-even point at various prices. The break-even point is the level of sales at which revenues equal total costs. By examining the various sales levels in relation to their break-even points, the cruise line can determine the optimal selling price for a particular good or service. When a cruise line obtains and analyzes information about its competitors, it is conducting a competitive analysis. A cruise line reviews its income statement to evaluate its income in relation to its expenses. The cruise line obtains information from the government to ensure that it is complying with regulations.

Negotiates a lease agreement with a property owner. A lease is a contract to use property that belongs to someone else for a specific period of time and a specific amount of rent. When a small travel-agency owner negotiates a lease with the property owner, s/he must consider many factors including the rent amount, the property taxes, and property insurance. Property owners may include taxes and insurance in the leaser's monthly rent amount, or they may bill the taxes and insurance separately at certain intervals. The small  travel-agency owner (leaser) must understand how the property owner handles these types of payment before signing the lease. Rent, (property) insurance, and property taxes are not primary factors that small  travel-agency owners consider when they apply for trademark protection with the government, hire new employees, or develop labor contracts.

Preventative maintenance activity. For the safety of the crew and passengers, airlines must take great care to conduct a variety of preventative maintenance activities on the aircraft. This includes making sure that all electronic and mechanical functions of the aircraft are working correctly. It is important for the maintenance crew to make sure the oxygen masks are working correctly in case passengers need to use them during an emergency. Sanitation and housekeeping activities involve making sure that waste is disposed of properly and that the aircraft is tidy and clean. Oxygen masks are safety devices, not hospitality options.

The number and placement of water flotation devices. Travel and tourism businesses develop emergency procedures based on their particular situations and needs. Because cruise ships travel by seas and oceans, they need to develop water-evacuation plans if an emergency occurs. The plan should include procedures about accessing flotation devices such as life preservers and lifeboats. The number of the ship's safety deposit boxes and tourist attractions at the ports of call are not important considerations when developing emergency procedures for a cruise ship. Rooming options are product/service management considerations.

Baggage and personal effect insurance. Because there are many types of insurance options available for travelers, travel agents should be familiar with all of them so they can explain the various options to clients. Baggage and personal effect insurance protects travelers from losses associated with damaged or misplaced property, such as luggage and luggage contents. Clients purchase trip cancellation and interruption insurance to protect them from financial losses when trips are cancelled or changed due to unforeseen circumstances. Personal accident and sickness insurance protects travelers from financial losses associated with the trip if they become sick or injured. Airline flight insurance covers passengers' death and injury losses in relation to aircraft crashes and accidents.

It also allows the job applicant to restate his/her interest in the job and reinforce the ways in which s/he can benefit the company, if hired. The applicant describes specific training, and experience in a resume, which may also include the applicant's references.

Competent. Travel businesses want to promote employees who are willing to accept more responsibility, authority, and challenges. Travel businesses tend to promote employees who have proven that they are reliable, trustworthy, and competent. A dependable employee consistently completes work on time. A trustworthy employee is honest and transparent. A competent employee demonstrates that s/he is capable of performing the necessary activities to complete the work. Travel businesses tend to promote employees who are interdependent rather than dependent (needy). Travel businesses may promote interesting employees, but it is not the most important quality for the employee to possess. Travel businesses also promote assertive, rather than aggressive employees, because assertive employees respect their own rights as well as the rights of others. Aggressive people do not respect the rights of others.

Be knowledgeable about tour sites. Because tour guides conduct sightseeing tours, they must know information about the sites that are of interest to tourists. They must also be able to answer questions that the tourists have about the sites. Although it is helpful to understand and speak foreign languages in some situations, this is not the most important aspect of the tour guide's job. Managers, rather than tour guides, delegate assignments and responsibilities. Tour guides should have excellent communication skills. The need for math and science skills depends on the type of tour the tour guide is leading. For example, a tour guide who is leading a park tour might need extensive knowledge about plants and trees, but this type of knowledge may not be important for a tour guide who is leading an art museum tour.

Interdependent relationship. Businesses in the travel and tourism industry are interdependent—they rely on each other to accomplish a goal. For travel and tourism businesses, the goal is to attract visitors and satisfy their needs and wants. For example, theme parks, historical tourist sites, and resorts depend on airlines and charter-bus companies to transport visitors to their locations. A merger occurs when two individual businesses combine to form one organization. Licensing is a business structure that requires the authorization or permission from an owner to another entity to use trademarked, copyrighted, or patented material for a specific activity during a specific time for the profit of both parties. Self-reliance (independence) is the ability to depend on one's own resources to accomplish a goal.

Conducting effective research. Being able to conduct effective research should be a goal of every company that wishes to introduce a new product; however, it is not a pricing objective. Pricing objectives relate to goals the company can achieve by setting a certain price. A company could gain a share of the market by introducing a low price, so that many consumers buy that company's product instead of another company's. A company could also reach a certain profit level by setting a price at a certain level. Price can also affect the company's image. If a company would like to be synonymous with luxury, the company will usually price its products at a higher level than a company that wants to be seen as "affordable."

Predatory pricing. Predatory pricing is a tactic that involves a business that prices its products very low so competitors cannot effectively compete in the marketplace. This often causes the competitors to go out of business, which can lead to a monopoly. A monopoly is a condition in which one supplier controls the market, and there are no substitute goods or services readily available. Predatory pricing is unethical and is illegal in many countries. Price lining is the practice of selling products at a limited number of predetermined price points or levels. Captive pricing is a tactic in which the business sets a low price for the primary product and sets high prices for the product's accessories. Bait-and-switch is an activity that involves promoting a low-priced item to attract customers to whom the business then tries to sell a higher priced item.

Bundle. When a travel business combines several travel products and sells them for one all-inclusive price, it using a bundle product pricing strategy. Tour and travel businesses often bundle travel products (e. g, airfare, hotel accommodations, rental car) to encourage clients to buy travel products that they otherwise might not purchase. The price of the bundled products is usually lower than the combined price of the products sold separately. The lower price provides the travel client with an incentive to buy. The odd pricing strategy involves setting selling prices below even-dollar amounts to suggest a bargain. Prestige pricing involves deliberately putting an artificially high price on a good or service to suggest high quality and status. Captive pricing involves setting a price for support products that must be used with a main product. In many situations, the business sets a low price for the main product, and high prices for the support products.

Product lifecycle management (PLM). PLM provides a shared platform for the creation, organization, and dissemination of product-related information across the entire enterprise. PDM software can be considered the initial phase of PLM since its intent was to control and manage product information; however, its use was limited because it was highly technical, failing to provide information outside the engineering area. ERP software is used enterprise-wide for information far beyond that of products. Customer relationship management software enables businesses to track customer information.

Creative thinking. Creative thinking involves the ability to generate new ideas, approaches, or solutions to problems. Creative thinking requires a person to be flexible and open-minded. By thinking in creative ways, a person can often identify or recognize a product opportunity (e.g., travel product), which is a favorable circumstance that presents itself to provide a good or service that consumers are willing to buy. Recordkeeping is the process of systematically recording, organizing, and destroying all the types of information necessary for operational and financial decision-making. Company records and current technology are often helpful tools to use when identifying new product opportunities, but they are not used in all situations.

Service-gap analysis. To maintain or grow market share, a cruise line should evaluate its customers' satisfaction levels with its services. To do this, the cruise line might conduct a service-gap analysis. The analysis helps the cruise line understand the differences among the cruise line's actual service performance and the customers' expectations. After determining these differences, the cruise line can take steps to close the gap, if problems exist.  The cruise line will not determine the best way to improve its customers' experiences by conducting a promotional assessment, break-even analysis, or industry assessment.

Travel businesses charge higher prices for customized services, which can lead to higher profit margins. Customized services are services that are developed to meet individual customer's needs and wants. Two potential benefits of offering customized services are higher profit margins and greater customer satisfaction. However, offering customized services does not save a travel business time. In fact, customized services take more time, not less. Standardized services are services that are as homogeneous as possible. Customized services are by definition not standardized services. Therefore, customizing its services does not help a travel business to deliver more consistent products to its customers.

Technology is one of many tools that successful travel agencies use to provide customer service. Both large and small travel agencies use a variety of technological and non-technological tools to provide customer service—from follow-up telephone calls and web-site ordering options to friendly return policies and knowledgeable staff. Sometimes, it's the small, personal touches (e.g., hand-written thank you notes) that make a travel agency's customer-service efforts stand out from its competitors. Although many customers prefer the personal service that only people can provide, many customers prefer the conveniences that technology provides, such as ATMs and online shopping.

Identify appropriate sightseeing activities. When planning tours, a tour wholesaler must consider the target market's needs and wants, and plan tour activities that will best satisfy those needs and wants. For example, if the target market consists of a group of senior citizens that is interested in visiting historical battlefield sites, the tour operator would not plan sightseeing activities, such as whale-watching or baseball stadium tours. A travel agent, rather than a tour wholesaler, would confirm a client's airline reservation. Selling policies are the general rules that a business's salespeople follow in selling situations. Processing fees are charges that an individual or business pays for a service or activity that another individual or business performs. A tour wholesaler would not pay processing fees, confirm airline reservations, or develop selling policies when planning a tour.

Book first-class airline seats. Travel agents often customize services to accommodate a client's preferences or special needs. For example, a client may request seating in a specific area of the aircraft, such as first-class. First-class seating usually allows passengers to enter and exit before other passengers. And, first-class seats are usually larger and more comfortable than the other seats on the aircraft. Although the client is taking the same flight as other passengers, the client's experience will be different because of the customized services. Customized services are often more expensive, but many clients are willing to pay for them, because these “extras” make the clients' travel experiences more enjoyable. Giving the client a copy of his/her itinerary, advising the client where s/he can obtain passports, and providing a client with a receipt of payment are examples of standard services.

Target similar markets. When developing vacation packages, tour wholesalers must identify travel and tourism businesses that offer different types of goods and services, but target similar markets. For example, a tour wholesaler might want to develop a warm-weather winter vacation package targeted to cold-weather dwellers. The tour wholesaler would seek relationships with a hotel and a theme park that are located in the same warm-weather location, and want to attract vacationers from cold-weather locations. The wholesaler may also want to establish a relationship with an airline that provides air transportation from cold-weather sites to the warm-weather destination to round out the travel product. The purpose of a lobbying group is to influence government legislation. Employee-incentive programs are designed to reward employees for good work performance. A tour wholesaler would not establish marketing relationships with travel and tourism businesses because they belong to lobbying groups or have employee-incentive programs. Favorable marketing relationships are not developed simply because a business uses promotional techniques. All businesses must use some promotion to survive in the marketplace.

"This is the lowest price you'll ever see for a Caribbean cruise!" Marketers who embellish upon the truth when describing their products often make exaggerated claims. The travel business may be advertising cruises for the very lowest price in the history of that particular travel business, but it has no way of knowing if the competition might offer an even lower price next week or next year. "We're open evenings and weekends!" states a fact that can be proven, so it is not an exaggerated claim. As long as a business follows through on its promises to give customers a $100 discount on a vacation package or other pricing discounts, then the travel business is also not making an exaggerated claim.

Opt-in e-mail. When a travel agency uses opt-in e-mail, it sends electronic promotional messages with a recipient's permission. E-mail is a cost-effective way to send promotional messages because the travel agency is sending messages only to individuals who want the travel information. Another advantage to using opt-in e-mail is that the travel agency does not spend money on postage, printing, telephone calls, etc. Direct mail is sent through the postal service to consumers' homes and businesses. This is one of the most expensive forms of promotion. Spam is "junk" e-mail, which is an unsolicited message sent to a recipient. Recipients often discard spam without reading it. Indirect mail is direct mail that the recipient passes to another person.

Consumers' privacy rights. Telemarketing is an advertising medium that utilizes telephone service to promote a product. To protect consumers' privacy, some governments have passed laws that limit telemarketing practices. Unrestrained trade is the exchange of goods or services without control or regulation. In most countries, trade is subject to various degrees of government control. Affirmative action policies are general rules that companies develop and follow to provide special employment consideration to disadvantaged groups.

Internet. By accessing the Internet, consumers can log on to their e-mail and visit web sites. Opt-in e-mail allows travel businesses to send promotional messages with the receivers' permission, so travel businesses can send promotional messages, coupons, and offers to the customers who are most likely to purchase the product. By accessing a travel business's web site, customers can book trips, and check travel information, and interact with the travel business's employees through text messaging. A press release is a factual announcement sent to the media to be used as a news item. A database is computerized storage for a travel business's information and facts. A newspaper is a form of nonpersonal promotion rather than a channel that allows travel businesses to customize messages.

Promotion. Promotion is the element of marketing that involves communicating and sending messages to inform, persuade, or remind customers of a travel and tourism business's products. An online travel business that sends an e-mail about a special product offer is using promotion. Product/Service management is a marketing function that involves obtaining, developing, maintaining, and improving a product or service mix in response to market opportunities. Operations management is the process of planning, controlling, and monitoring the day-to-day activities required for continued business functioning. Distribution is an aspect of operations.

Sombrero, poster of Cancun, beach towel, and sunglasses. A travel agency that is running a special offer for Mexican beach destinations is likely to display items that relate to the beach and to the Mexican culture. Therefore, the travel agency is most likely to display “beach” items such as sunscreen, sunglasses, beach towels, or even a model of a sailboat. It would also display items that relate to the Mexican culture, such as maracas (hand-held shaking instrument), a sombrero (hat), and a poster of Cancun, which is a popular beach destination in Mexico. Athens is a city in Greece, the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, France, and the Bahamas are part of the Caribbean Islands. The travel agency would not display materials for these destinations when it is promoting beach destinations in Mexico.

Businesses. Without a loyal customer base, a business cannot thrive in the marketplace. A business that develops and implements favorable service policies not only makes the customers happy, but helps salespeople sell the travel product and improve the business's overall ability to build a loyal clientele. A society is a group of individuals that shares an environment. A coalition is a group of individuals who gather for a specific purpose. Societies and coalitions do not exist for the purpose of building clientele.

A salesperson gives a ski trip to a buyer who makes a large purchase. Bribery is an illegal payment (e.g., cash, gifts, trips) intended to secure business or products in return. When a salesperson gives a free ski trip to a buyer in exchange for the buyer's business, the salesperson is engaging in a bribe, which is unethical, and often illegal. Advising a customer about a discount and telling a customer about a limited-time offer are ethical actions. A salesperson who exaggerates a product's capabilities is misleading rather than bribing the customer, and is also an unethical, illegal action.

Manage contacts. Technology helps salespeople perform their jobs more efficiently.

Sales presentation. A salesperson has to prove to customers that a product has the features that will benefit them. This process is known as feature-benefit selling. Feature-benefit selling should always occur during the sales presentation as part of the sales dialogue and, if applicable, the product demonstration. It would be difficult to explain a product's features and benefits during the approach phase of selling because the salesperson has not determined what the customer needs. During the discovery phase of selling, the salesperson is asking questions to determine which products to show the customer. During follow-up, the salesperson reaffirms the buyer-seller relationship, which may involve reviewing the product's features and benefits.

Cultural. Travelers visit destinations for a variety of reasons. Some travelers seek cultural destinations—places where they can attend museums, concerts, and plays. Montreal and New York City are examples of destinations in which travelers can experience a variety of cultural venues. Cultural destinations are located in both warm- and cold-weather locations. Natural destinations (e.g., parks) tend to attract travelers who are interested in nature.

Roman coliseum. People travel to destinations for different reasons. Some travelers are interested in visiting historical sites, such as the Roman coliseum, which is an ancient architectural structure located in Rome, Italy. Niagara Falls, a waterfall located on the border of the United States and Canada, attracts travelers interested in nature. Amusement parks attract thrill-seeking travelers who desire entertainment. A golf resort is an example of a sport and recreation destination.

For leisure. A leisure traveler goes to different locations for fun and enjoyment. Because people vary, fun and enjoyment mean different things to different people. For some people, leisure travel involves going to one location, sunbathing, and relaxing. Another leisure traveler might enjoy visiting museums, sightseeing, and visiting family. Many factors motivate family travel including vacation, illness, and death. There is not enough information provided to determine if Mr. and Mrs. Jones want to visit museums or intend to see family members. Business travel involves traveling to different locations for business purposes.

A luxury cabin in a well-known national park. It is important for a travel agent to determine the type of vacation that a client wants to take before recommending destinations. A travel agent who determines that a client is interested in biking, hiking, fishing, and enjoying nature would likely recommend destinations near or at national parks, which allow visitors to engage in these types of activities. The Egyptian Pyramids would likely interest a person who is interested in ancient history. A large city or a well-known theme park may not have accommodations that allow the client to bike, fish, hike, or enjoy nature.

Final destination is several hours away from the airport. A traveler might rent a car when his/her final destination is located in a remote area that is far from the airport or when the final destination does not have an airport nearby. In some situations, it is less expensive for a traveler to purchase airline tickets and depart from a distant airport and rent a car to drive to the desired destination. If available, shuttle and bus services are often better modes of transportation from the airport than car rentals, especially when the traveler's hotel accommodations are near the airport, or when the traveler is going to cities where parking is difficult, and the traveler is not familiar with the area. It is common for airline passengers to make connecting flights to reach their final destinations. Connecting airline flights do not indicate that a traveler needs a rental car.

Save time. Travel agents usually book tours for their clients by telephoning the tour operator or through the tour operator's web site. The advantage to booking the tour through the tour operator's web site is that it saves time because the travel agent does not need wait on the telephone to talk to a tour operator's employee to book the tour. The process of booking a tour through a tour operator's web site does not always reduce the travel agent's workload, increase satisfaction, or eliminate paperwork.

Determine the client's needs and wants. One of the first steps in selling involves determining the client's needs and wants. After the travel agent determines the client's needs and wants, then s/he can select the appropriate travel products to present to the client. For example, if a client indicates an interest in a ski vacation in the French Alps, then the travel agent should not present and try to sell the client an African safari trip. For this reason, the travel agent should limit the amount of travel literature s/he presents to the client based on her/his specific area of interest. An aspect of determining a client's needs and wants involves determining the client's price range. Therefore, it is not always appropriate for the travel agent to present the most expensive trip the agency offers. The travel agent does not need the client to present referrals and references to sell the client a travel product.

Prepare formal sales presentations. Travel businesses often sell trips to groups such schools, athletic clubs, businesses, and professional organizations. Because several people are often involved in the decision-making process for the group's trip, the travel business may need to prepare and present a formal sales presentation to the group. This provides the travel business with an opportunity to discuss unique features and advantages of the business's travel options. Travel businesses would not solicit input from their competitors. Governments issue visas. The purpose of a loyalty program is to provide top customers with rewards and incentives, which will encourage them to continue purchasing from the business.

Contact and payment information. Jason needs to obtain the traveler's contact information, which includes his/her name, mailing address, and telephone number. In many situations, the airline sends confirmation and tickets to the customer's e-mail address, so this is often useful contact information. Most airlines require partial or full payment at the time of the reservation, so Jason needs to obtain payment information such as the traveler's credit or debit card type (e.g., Visa), credit or debit card number, and the credit or debit card expiration date. Travelers present their passports to customs and authorized airport personnel when traveling to other countries. Identification numbers and travel codes are not information that an airline employee needs to obtain from travelers to reserve airline tickets.

All-inclusive packages. It is important for travel agents to determine their clients' preferences when recommending travel destinations. An important element to consider is dining preferences. All-inclusive packages include the cost of all food and beverages in the price of the clients' lodging accommodations. This is often a preferable option for clients who want to know all costs up front and do not want to worry about paying for food during the trip. Cruise ships and large resorts often have several types of dining venues (e.g., Italian food, buffet style) available to accommodate the tastes of many passengers or guests. European plans do not include the cost of food and beverages. Special-interest packages include activities that appeal to the clients' interests, such as historical tours or fantasy baseball camps. Continental plans include cold breakfast items (e.g., cereal, pastries, coffee) in the selling price of the lodging accommodations.

$2,625. Transportation, food, entertainment, lodging, and conference fees are a few expenses that business travelers encounter when they attend business events and functions. Their employers need to know these costs ahead of time to ensure that funds are available for business travel. To determine the amount of money that the business traveler anticipates spending to attend the conference, add together all of the estimated expenses ($450 + $325 + $1,250 + $600 =  $2,625).

Outside cabin. Cruise ships offer a variety of lodging options at different pricing levels to appeal to many types of passengers. The sleeping accommodations on a ship are called cabins or staterooms. If a client wants a “room with a view,” the travel agent should book an outside cabin or stateroom, which has a porthole or window view. Inside cabins or staterooms do not have portholes or windows. The galley is the ship kitchen. The gangway is the walkway or aisle.

Employees, society, and the agency's profits. To make ethical decisions, travel-agency managers should consider the impact that their actions will have on their employees, the society, and their travel agencies' profits. Travel-agency managers have an obligation to all three. They must look after the welfare of their employees, they have a moral responsibility to protect the greater society, and they must help their travel agencies to be as profitable as possible. Pay raises, bonuses, and suppliers are not necessarily things that travel-agency managers need to consider when faced with an ethical dilemma. In fact, travel-agency managers may make more ethical decisions when financial rewards are not taken into consideration.
