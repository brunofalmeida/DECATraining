General partnership. A general partnership is designed to combine the capital, experience, and abilities
of two or more people. Corporation ownership would not be acceptable because Karla and Brad's only
involvement would be in the growth and possible profits of the business by buying shares of stock. A
limited partnership would allow Karla and Brad to invest but have limited responsibilities in operations
and management. A sole proprietorship would be owned by one person.

Trade publications. Trade publications are reliable sources of information for various professions (e.g.,
human resources) and industries (e.g., restaurant). Many professions and industries publish magazines
and periodicals on a weekly or quarterly basis. Online articles are often available on a trade or
professional organization's web site. Online message boards and mailing lists may not provide the most
relevant, accurate, or up-to-date information. Government publications may provide relevant information;
however, archived information is usually older rather than up-to-date.

Don't rush. When Millie skips ahead of the knitting directions in her book, she is rushing forward without
all the information she needs to make the scarf. Reading and following directions is not a race. Taking
your time and following the steps provided will ensure that you don't leave something out or do
something incorrectly. This improves your chances of doing it right. In this situation, Millie is not ignoring
the tips to know when to speak, accept responsibility, or note key words.

4. B
Asking appropriate questions. Being a good listener is important on the job and in other types of
relationships. One way to be a good listener is to ask appropriate questions in order to clarify what the
speaker is saying. For example, this means asking specific questions about how to perform a task if a
manager is explaining a new job function. It does not mean continually interrupting the speaker with
irrelevant comments or asking questions that do not pertain to the conversation. Good listeners look at
the speaker and focus on what s/he is saying rather than thinking about a response.

5. B
Correct grammar. Your image as an employee can be enhanced by your use of good grammar, rather
than slang, and by your ability to communicate clearly and effectively with customers and fellow
employees. Not all occupations require a knowledge of several languages. The use of technical terms, or
jargon, is limited since it may be difficult for employees to master and for customers to understand.

Facial expressions. Nonverbal cues are communication that involves the use of gestures or facial
expressions, rather than the use of words. Facial expressions usually are the most important aspect of
nonverbal cues or body language. For example, when people feel emotions such as happiness or anger,
those emotions are expressed through smiles, frowns, and eye patterns. It is easy to see that someone is
happy if s/he is smiling. Leg movements are a type of body language; however, they are not as effective
a way to interpret nonverbal cues. Clothing style and office decor are nonverbal cues also, but they are
not as easy to interpret as facial expressions.

7. C
Demonstrating a procedure. If possible, it is always useful to demonstrate a procedure when giving
verbal directions. The visual demonstration reinforces the verbal explanation and makes it easier for
employees to understand. This might include an actual demonstration, a video of a demonstration, or
diagrams that explain the procedure. The goal is to increase understanding, particularly if the directions
are detailed, or the procedure is new or complicated. Taking notes often helps employees to understand
and follow directions. Speaking in a loud voice will not help to clarify information. It is effective to
encourage questions rather than to limit them.

Speaking with coworkers. Jargon is a specialized language known only to a certain group of people.
Industries and companies often use jargon that is meaningful to their businesses and may not be easily
understood by people outside their industries or companies. Coworkers are more likely to use jargon
because they are familiar with the terms and their meanings or applications. New customers, friends,
business associates, and acquaintances may not be familiar with a specific industry's jargon.

9. B
Ask the caller, "How may I help you?" This question requires callers to identify the purpose of their calls.
It is courteous, since you cannot provide assistance until you know what is needed. Asking, "What did
you want?" sounds abrupt and impolite. Waiting for callers to ask questions would waste your time and
that of the caller's. Answering promptly with a friendly greeting is a guideline for giving good telephone
service, but would not identify the purpose of the call.

Key points. Effective note-taking involves writing down the most important information or key points for
future reference. A person generally speaks faster than another person writes, so it would be difficult for
a person to write down every detail or word the speaker says. The key points cited during a seminar may
or may not be of interest to the businessperson. Inaccurate statements should not be cited during a
seminar.

Purpose of the message. Effective written communications immediately explain the reason for the
message. Readers may not take the time to read lengthy messages in search of their purpose.
Businesspeople should explain the purpose quickly and in concise terms in order to make sure that the
receiver will read the letter. The company's structure, goals, and purpose would not be explained

Bullet-pointed list. Writers often use bullet-pointed lists to break up a lot of content into smaller “chunks”
of information. Writers use bullet-pointed lists to emphasize the most important information, clarify
concepts, and summarize key points. Long paragraphs and complex sentence structures tend to
overwhelm readers; therefore, readers often overlook or miss important information. The signature block
is the element of a letter in which the writer signs his/her name.

Appropriate way to cite his resources. To provide consistency throughout written documents, certain
businesses or industries often follow a specific writing style, such as Associated Press (AP) or Chicago
Manual. Because each style manual varies and often follows different standards, writers should check
the appropriate style manual to ensure that s/he is formatting a resource citation correctly. A computersoftware
manual, the computer-software “help” function, or a computer-software web site provides
information about setting up tables in documents. A dictionary or glossary provides formal definitions of
words. A thesaurus provides synonyms for words.

Signature. Text appearing at the bottom of an e-mail that indicates a person's or business's identity and
contact information is known as the e-mail signature. Many businesses require their employees to include
a signature identifying themselves and their contact information in all of their outgoing e-mail. An e-mail
attachment is a computer file that is sent with an e-mail message. An e-mail carbon copy is a duplicate of
an e-mail that is sent to someone else in addition to the primary recipient(s) of the message. E-mail
etiquette refers to a set of rules specifying how to behave and conduct oneself when writing and/or

Make sure you clearly understand customers' inquiries. Customers' inquiries are not always phrased in
such a way that employees can easily determine what customers want to know. Employees should find
out exactly what the customers are asking in order to give them the most accurate answers. Inquiries
should be handled as courteously as sales, which means spending whatever time is needed to answer
them. In many cases, it would be inappropriate to try to sell something to a customer who asks a
question. Employees who are busy with a sale can often take a moment to answer a single question for
another customer without being rude to the first customer. If the second customer has additional
questions, s/he should be asked to wait until you can give those questions your full attention.

Image. Business image is the view or opinion that customers have about a business. Salespeople can
improve the image of the company in the eyes of its customers by knowing company policies and
procedures and being able to accurately interpret them to the clientele. Properly explaining policies will
help to avoid misunderstandings and to improve the company's image. A routine is a regular course of

Immediate gratification. Opportunity cost is the benefit that is lost when a person decides to use scarce
resources for one purpose rather than another. When a person places $500 in the bank, the opportunity
(benefit) is having money available for the future. The cost of placing money in the bank means that the
person does not have the money to purchase a desired item. When a person purchases something that
s/he doesn't need but really wants, the benefit to the person is immediate gratification or a sense of
instant satisfaction that s/he has acquired the desired product. The opportunity cost (benefit lost) is not a
higher discretionary income, lower salary or wages, or long-term dissatisfaction.

(premium). For example, a company that loses its inventory and equipment in a fire can file a claim with
its property insurance carrier to obtain money to purchase new inventory and equipment if the policy
premiums are up-to-date and the policy covers such losses. Insurance does not necessarily reduce a
business's security needs, lower personal tax obligation, or enhance economic utility.

Revenues and expenses. Accounting is the process of keeping and interpreting financial records.
Information that a business keeps and tracks in its accounting records includes its revenues and its
expenses. Revenues refer to income or money that flows into the business from activities such as sales.
The business also keeps track of its expenses in its accounting records. Expenses are the monies the
business owes to others (e.g., vendors) and flows out of the business. By keeping records of revenue
and expenses, the business can evaluate its profits—the amount of money left over after all the
expenses are paid. Products (goods and services), trends, forecasts, and market share are types of
marketing information.

Working capital management. A company's current balance of assets and liabilities falls under the focus
of working capital management. Working capital management involves short-term decisions about cash
flow. Return on capital is a component of working capital management that refers to how well a business
is generating cash flow in relation to its invested capital. Capital investment decisions are made for the
long-term and do not relate to current assets and liabilities. The cash conversion cycle is a component of
working capital management that refers to how long a business's money is "tied up" between purchasing
raw materials and receiving cash from sales.

Politicians are unethical and should not be trusted. When analyzing information, it is important to
separate opinion from fact. Facts contain true data or information. An opinion is a person's point of view
or belief about a topic. A person may believe that all politicians are unethical and untrustworthy, but not
all people believe this statement, nor can the statement be proven. The alternative statements are facts.

Financial and problem-solving. Entrepreneurs need to understand financial or money concepts and how

Problem-solving skills can help an entrepreneur protect company profitability by finding new ways or
solutions to overcome obstacles, which may affect revenue. Passive is defined as dormant or not active.
Skills are learned and practiced and, therefore, cannot be passive. Operations is a business function
rather than a skill. Possession of domestic skills (e.g., cooking) does not generally protect a company's
profitability. Technical skills are specialized applications used to accomplish business objectives.
Language skills refers to the degree a person can communicate with others in a verbal or written manner.
Team building refers to the manner in which a person interacts in a group of people to accomplish a goal.
Although entrepreneurs can use technical, language, and team-building skills to increase or maintain
corporate profitability, they must possess a fiscally responsible mindset.
