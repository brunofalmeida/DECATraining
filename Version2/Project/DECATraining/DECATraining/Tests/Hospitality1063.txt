Fraud. A tort is a private wrongdoing against another person. Businesses can be held responsible in a
variety of torts. For example, suppose a business's employee intentionally provides misleading product
information to a customer in order to make a sale. Then, the customer purchases and is injured by the
product based on the employee's misleading information. The customer may file a civil lawsuit against
the business, and in some situations, the business's employee for fraudulent behavior. Assault and
intrusion are criminal acts that are addressed in the criminal court system rather than the civil court
system. Defamation is a tort that involves harm to an individual's or business's reputation.

 2. C
Administrative. Administrative law deals with the rules and regulations that have been established by
governmental agencies. The legislative branch of the government (i.e., U.S. Congress and Canadian
Parliament at the Federal level) establishes these agencies, which have the authority to enact and
enforce regulations for various administrative functions, including aviation, taxation, and commerce. For
example, in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates air-transportation
functions (i.e., airspace, aircraft safety); the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) handles issues related to
personal and business taxes; and the Federal Commerce Commission (FCC) handles issues related to
business and commerce. The legislative branch of government introduces and passes statutes. The
judicial branch of government (court systems) interprets the law. The executive branch of the government
guides government policy, and in some countries, has the power to veto legislation.

 3. C
It is legal for an airline to overbook a flight. Since there are no laws to protect the travel consumer from
overbooking, bumping passengers from flights is common when traveling by air. The U.S. Department of
Transportation does, however, require that airlines first ask for volunteers to give up their seats in
exchange for compensation. This may be in the form of cash or a voucher. The amount a passenger is
compensated for lost luggage is subject to negotiation. Most airlines have a ceiling on the amount paid
($2,500/passenger); international travelers are paid $9.07/lb. Currently, there is no international "Bill of
Rights." The United States Congress has developed several options for an airline passenger "Bill of
Rights," but there is nothing on the law books as of yet (August, 2009). Airlines are not required to pay
any compensation for flight delays due to bad weather.

Retailers. Retailers are businesses that buy consumer goods or services and sell them to the ultimate
consumer. Wal-Mart, Domino's Pizza, and Avis Rent-a-Car all sell directly to consumers. Wholesalers
are businesses that buy goods from producers or agents and sell to retailers. Agents assist in the sale
and/or promotion of goods and services but do not take title to them. Industrial distributors are
intermediaries that buy industrial goods and services and sell them to industrial users.

Hinder competition. Antitrust laws are regulations that prevent a person or company from taking any
actions to restrain free trade and competition in the marketplace. Businesses should understand the
types of business activities that violate antitrust laws, so they do not engage in them. If a business
requires tying agreements or attempts to create a monopoly, it may be violating antitrust laws. The
government fines a business when it violates antitrust laws. Actions that restrict efficiency or prohibit
authority do not violate antitrust laws.

 6. D
Follow the written directions in the proper sequence. The first step in applying written directions to
perform tasks usually involves reading the directions. Employees need to understand the written
directions before they can apply them. If employees do not read the directions and apply them in the
proper sequence, they may perform the tasks incorrectly. Therefore, reading the directions for
understanding and meaning is an important step. The use of shortcuts to complete a task may or may not
be included in the manual's written directions.

 7. C
Sharing and understanding. Sharing means that there must be one who sends the message and one
who reacts to it. Understanding means that both sender and receiver grasp the same message.
Telling/Informing is a one-way process. All messages have words but meanings are generally not
included. Personal beliefs and attitudes determine if you care about a message or not.

 8. B
Agree on ground rules. Once you know your group's purpose, you can (as a group) lay some simple
ground rules for appropriate behavior during the discussion. Finding out what people know about the
subject and contributing in a useful way occur later in the process. Volunteering a new idea is a
discussion tool for contributing in an open-minded way.

 9. D
Speak loudly enough for the audience to hear the message. When making an oral presentation to a
group, the speaker should speak loudly enough for everyone in the audience to hear what s/he is saying.
If audience members cannot hear what the speaker is saying, they might misunderstand or misinterpret
the message. A speaker should try not to turn away from the audience when presenting visual aids and
should maintain eye contact with the audience. Because swaying back and forth can distract the
audience, the speaker should avoid this type of movement.

Preparing outlines. Businesspeople often are expected to write business letters on a regular basis. One
technique that helps them to write effective business letters is to first prepare an outline. An outline is a
general plan giving only the main points to be covered. Preparing an outline helps businesspeople to
decide exactly what they want to say in the letter and to organize their thoughts. Businesspeople then
can use the outlines to write effective letters. Businesspeople usually do not ask questions, consult
references, or develop charts in order to write effective business letters.

Respond positively. Persuasive messages often ask people to do something, such as buy a product,
make a donation, give a speech, etc. To be effective, the message should be written in a way that makes
it easy for the person to respond positively and agree to do what is asked. The messages might contain
toll-free telephone numbers, an offer to deliver a product for free, or to pick up a donation. People are
more likely to respond positively if it is easy to do so. Persuasive messages do not need to be read
slowly. The writer of the message organizes it logically. People might politely answer persuasive
messages, but the intent is to have them respond positively.

Hiring process. Customer relations skills such as courtesy and friendliness should be emphasized during
a business's hiring process. Employees are the most important factor in a business's customer relations.
Businesses must hire people who will present a positive face for the company to the public. Courtesy
and friendliness are not skills that relate to market research, facilities design, or technology planning.

Business process management. A customer-centric business is constantly striving to align its objectives
and activities with customer needs. Doing so is known as business process management (BPM). BPM
focuses on this alignment by stressing innovation, flexibility, and most importantly, technology. Employee
training involves educating workers on how to best perform their job duties. Organizational structuring
refers to the way business functions relate within a company. Continuous improvement refers to
continuously evaluating business processes to make them more efficient and effective.

Define service differently. Customer service involves performing activities and providing benefits which
lead to customer satisfaction with the product and/or the business. Channel members, which are all of
the individuals and businesses that assist in moving products from the producer to the end user, depend
on each other to perform activities leading to customer satisfaction. While it is important to have products
when and where they are needed, it is also important to remember that customers often have different
ideas about service. For example, one customer may not accept a substitution for a certain item or brand
because they are concerned about quality, while another customer may want the item quickly and will
accept the substitution. Each customer has different expectations, so each customer defines service
differently. Expecting low service levels, wanting immediate delivery, and refusing late shipments are
different factors that influence how customers define service.

Economic goods and services. People purchase both tangible objects (goods) and productive activities
(services) in order to satisfy their economic wants. When consumers purchase one good rather than
another, they are casting their dollar, or economic, votes for the item they purchased and against the
items not purchased. Noneconomic wants are satisfied by free goodsitems which can be obtained
without spending money.

Free-trade agreements. Free-trade agreements lessen the trade restrictions (e.g., tariffs, quotas,
licenses) among countries. For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trade
agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that has eliminated trade barriers. When fewer
trade barriers exist, there are more opportunities for businesses to buy and sell products in other
countries. Protectionism is a government's policy to protect domestic industries and businesses against
foreign competition. Protectionism, language barriers, and strict safety standards often hinder a
business's ability to enter international markets.

Analyze organizational resources. Organizational resources are everything the business uses to operate.
These resources include tangible items such as equipment and capital, as well as intangibles such as
patents and brand names. It is important to analyze the resources that are available in order for
businesses to adapt to today's markets. They need to determine if they have the capacity to adapt using
current resources. For example, a business might find that it needs new equipment in order to increase
productivity and remain competitive in today's market. Businesses do not necessarily need to hire new
management staff, participate in international trade, or remodel corporate facilities to be able to adapt to
today's markets.

Private. A market economy is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution are
owned and controlled by individuals and businesses. This ownership is not limited except by the abilities

controlled conditions.

Consumers and producers are borrowing more money. During the growth, or expansion, phase of
business cycles, interest rates on loans are low, thereby encouraging consumers and producers to
borrow more money in order to make even more purchases. During the peak phase, demand for all
resources exceeds their availability. During the peak and the contraction phases, people become less
hopeful about the future of business and begin to save more money. Also during the contraction phase,
producers reduce their purchase of new goods; instead, they try to sell the goods which are currently in
inventory.

Prejudice. Prejudice is opinion or judgment that is based on feeling or hearsay, rather than fact. Prejudice
often is a cause of discrimination, which is the unfair treatment of a person or a group based on the
person's or group's characteristics, such as race, religion, or gender. For example, if an employer
assumes that a person in not capable of doing a job simply because that person is a member of a certain
race, the employer is guilty of discrimination based on prejudice toward race. Diversity is all the ways in
which people differ, including background, age, gender, and race. Stress is a mental or emotional feeling
of pressure or tension. Harassment is any kind of behavior toward another person that is carried out for
the purpose of annoying or threatening the individual.

Bargaining. Bargaining is a negotiating strategy that uses "give-and-take" tactics to reach an agreement.
One person gives up something the other person wants and, in return, that person offers something the
first person wants. A collaborative negotiating style is most likely to create an outcome that benefits both
parties. When both parties benefit, the result is usually fair, rather than unfair. Peer pressure occurs when
one person tries to influence another person of equal status to act in a particular way. Most often, peer
pressure is used to describe negative types of behavior, such as smoking. Self-control refers to a

Explain how the change will benefit them. A change leader is a person who has the ability to guide others
and persuade them to alter their opinions or actions. Because some individuals have a difficult time
accepting and making changes, change leaders must be able to explain how a change will actually
benefit them. By doing so, the change leader has a better chance of persuading others that a new idea,
process, or action will improve a situation. Telling others that there is a better way of doing things (even if
it is true) might put them on the defensive and make them more resistant to change. Giving others as
little information as possible may make you appear like you are being dishonest, which may hinder your
ability to persuade others because they won't trust you. In many situations, facts and statistics aren't
necessary or relevant to the proposed change.

When Naomi purchased office supplies, she presented the cashier with a card that automatically
withdrew funds from her business's checking account. A debit card is a common method of payment for
goods and services. Issued by financial institutions (e.g., banks), a cardholder scans the card into a
machine at the point of sale. The information is transmitted to the appropriate location, and the funds are
electronically transferred from the cardholder's checking or savings account to the seller's account. Credit
is the arrangement in which businesses and individuals can purchase now and pay later. Individuals and
businesses can obtain the goods and services that they need right away, such as airline tickets, and then
pay for the tickets when they receive their statements from their lending institutions. Some businesses
offer membership or customer-loyalty cards, which provide their members or customers with product
discounts. Gift cards are store-issued vouchers that a gift giver can purchase for another person to use to
buy the store's products.

Interpreted in different ways. Accounting is the process of keeping and interpreting financial records.
Because many issues and situations in business are different, it is possible to interpret financial
information in different ways. Some of these interpretations may be more ethical than others. In order to
interpret financial records in a way that is ethical, it is necessary to consider how others are affected by
the interpretation. For example, if investors are hurt by the financial interpretation, it may be unethical.
Not all financial records are made available to the public or reviewed by government agencies. Financial
records often are communicated in writing; however, this is not why ethics in accounting is important.

Electronically processing information. Human resources management involves gathering and maintaining

Computer systems are able to store vast amounts of information in databases, allow managers to access
and update information when necessary, and organize information according to specific criteria. As a
result, fewer employees are needed to process the information and the amount of paperwork is reduced,
which saves money for the business. The use of computer technology does not reduce the need to
interview candidates or analyze valuable feedback. Departmental managers delegate work and provide
their subordinates with feedback.

The businesses that fail to do their part to protect the environment often anger consumers, which may

surveys). Because more people are booking lodging facilities via the Internet, the use of travel agents is
decreasing. Satellite roving devices and service rating advisors are not common terms used to describe
concepts related to the hospitality industry.

Prepare a budget. Most projects have costs involved. However, before asking everyone you know to
make a contribution, it is important to prepare a budget. By developing a budget, project managers will
have an accurate picture of what it will cost to do the project. Then, they can ask others for the financial
resources to cover the costs. It is not necessary to open an account or arrange for credit before asking
for contributions. Holding a fund-raiser is one way to obtain financial assistance after preparing a budget

business to effectively maintain an inventory of supplies at the right level. The business does not tie up

automatic reorder system to maintain an adequate work environment, budget for expenses, or

Scheduling. Production scheduling establishes the timetable to be followed in production. Employees
responsible for scheduling look at the number of steps in the production process and estimate how long
each step will take. They then set times when each step should begin and end, and schedule delivery of
the resources that will be needed. Routing is the production activity that determines the sequence for the
steps in the production process. Dispatching is issuing orders for production to start. Planning is deciding
what will be produced, how it will be produced, and how much of it will be produced.

Give the robbers what they want to avoid potential injury. In order to deal with robbers, it is always best to
give in to their demands without causing a disturbance. Robbers want to enter a business and leave
quickly, and any startling activity could make them panic and cause employees additional harm. Although
it is good advice to keep as little cash on hand as possible to limit losses, it will not impact the actual
robbery situation. Keeping the safe locked will also limit losses but, again, doesn't keep the robbery from
occurring. As a rule of thumb, employees should not discuss the situation with anyone except
management and the police.

To be able to promote from within. Many businesses prefer to promote from within whenever possible
and help current employees move up the career ladder. To do this, businesses often provide
opportunities for their employees to continue their education or receive additional training. As a result,
they have a pool of qualified employees to choose from when higher-level jobs become available. This
benefits the employees because they can advance within the business. Businesses often provide
financial assistance, such as tuition reimbursement, to help employees continue their education.
However, that is not the reason for providing the additional training. Businesses do not provide
educational opportunities to identify problems in the company or to support the local community college.

Obtain further education and certification. Trade or professional organizations consist of individuals or

networking opportunities, the establishment of consistent industry standards, trade shows, and venues
for members to further their education (e.g., seminars, workshops, classes, certification) within the
industry. Continuing education programs can help people keep up with trends associated with their
industry. The availability of government funding is dependent on each government's resources and
guidelines. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that all governments provide financial support to trade
organizations. Joining a professional organization does not necessarily improve or increase employee
productivity. Joining a trade organization might help industry members learn about the use of promotion,
but it does not necessarily develop the materials or programs for them.

A decrease in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available. A decrease in the
number of guests occurs during economic slowdowns because people are reluctant to spend their
discretionary income on travel. Consequently, there is an increase in the number of rooms available as
more rooms become available for rent. An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the
number of rooms available does not follow the law of supply and demand, which suggests that as
demand for rooms go up, supply typically goes down. A decrease in the number of guests and a
decrease in the number of rooms available would work the other way because as demand goes down,
the supply of rooms available for rent typically goes up. An increase in the number of guests and a
decrease in the number of rooms available typically occurs during good economic times when people are
more willing to spend their discretionary income on travel.

Price. Price is the marketing element requiring marketers to determine the amount of money they will ask
in exchange for their products. In the travel and tourism industry, price is closely associated with
customers' perceptions of value and worth. If customers think the travel product has value and worth,
they are often willing to pay for it. Also, value and worth differ from customer to customer, so what is
value to one customer might not be value to another. For example, some people prefer economy hotels
because saving money is a value to them. To other people, receiving many services is a value that they
are willing to pay for. Profit is the monetary reward a business owner receives for taking the risk involved
in investing in a business. Place is the marketing element focusing on considerations in getting a
selected product in the right place at the right time. Promotion is a marketing function needed to
communicate information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome.

Encourage employees to report new product ideas from other restaurants they visit. New product ideas
come from a variety of internal and external sources. Some examples of internal sources include
personal observation; formal research and development activities; recommendations from corporate,
employees, family members, and people who provide professional assistance to the restaurant such as
bankers, attorneys, etc. The problem with asking family members for recommendations is that managers
might feel that they can't reject bad ideas. Competitors won't recommend new products because they
don't want to lose business to others. Although trade associations might suggest ideas for new products,
the fact that they're recommending the products to local restaurants would fail to give any one restaurant
a competitive advantage.

Businesses generally buy the item in larger quantities. A business's peak selling season occurs when
customer demand for certain goods and services is very high. For example, the demand for beachwear
and outdoor furniture is usually highest during the spring and summer months in the northern
hemisphere. Therefore, businesses generally try to order these types of items so they have enough on
hand to meet demand. Some types of businesses (e.g., resort gift shops) carry similar items need them
at the same time, so vendors and manufacturers might need more lead time to fill orders. Although
businesses might purchase small quantities of the item on a frequent basis, they run a risk of back-order
situations from their suppliers and, therefore, cannot meet customer demand. Although businesses
consider competition when marketing products, other factors are often considered when determining the
quantity of items to purchase.

Product extensions. A product extension is a good or service added to an existing product line or product

type of hotel and offers different levels of service or amenities have extensions from the main product
(hospitality services). Market potential refers to estimated revenues or income that can be generated
from a specific market segment. Franchising is a method of distributing goods and services through a
licensing arrangement between a parent company and another individual or company outside the parent
company. Multicorporate franchising is not a term used in the hospitality and tourism industry. Property

their friends. Other individuals access social bookmarking web sites to search for more trusted web
sites that focus on a particular topic. Because these individuals may bypass more traditional search
engines such as Google and Bing entirely, businesses often post their own web sites and blog entries on
social bookmarking sites as well. To improve their chances of being seen on these social bookmarking
sites even further, businesses also encourage their web site and blog visitors to tag and/or rank their
sites for many different social bookmarking sites. Facebook is a social networking web site, not a social

Amplified. Word-of-mouth marketing occurs when customers tell others of their satisfaction with a
particular business. Amplified word-of-mouth marketing takes place when marketers purposely
encourage their customers to share information about a business with others in their community. Clara's
Pizza Parlor, for example, deliberately asks visitors to its web site to send information about the
restaurantin the guise of a postcardto their families and friends. Organic word-of-mouth marketing is
another word-of-mouth strategy. Organic word-of-mouth marketing occurs when satisfied customers
voluntarily tell people around them about a business that they like, without the business prompting them
to do so. Celebrities are sometimes used as a word-of-mouth strategy, but that is not true of this
example. Inconspicuous word-of-mouth marketing is a fictitious term.

Factual. There are several strategies that copywriters can use to develop advertising copy. One of these
is the factual strategy that involves explaining what a product is, what it does, and how it benefits
consumers. Copywriters are using facts to promote the product, such as explaining size or composition.
For example, factual copy might state that a cell phone weighs less than one pound, is made of scratchresistant
material, and can be programmed to hold 500 numbers. The imaginative strategy would focus
on explaining new and unusual ways to use a product. The emotional strategy appeals to consumers on
a personal level and focuses on their feelings, such as love and loyalty. The emotional strategy also
includes an irrational appeal rather than a factual appeal.

possible. The alternatives are actions taken in creating a display rather than maintaining it.

Databases. A database is computerized storage for information and facts. The use of databases is one
way of tracking marketing-communications activities. For example, a business sends out 100,000
promotional letters to customers and receives 25,000 responses. The business maintains a database of
the names and characteristics of 100,000 customers as well as information about those who responded.
The business can analyze the database to track the effectiveness of the mailing in reaching the target
market. Questionnaires, surveys, and interviews are ways of obtaining marketing information rather than
ways of tracking marketing-communications activities.

Weekend discount package. Sales promotion is promotional activities other than advertising, personal
selling, and publicity that stimulate customer purchases. These activities include coupons, contests,
discounts, and premiums that are intended to attract customers. A hotel that offers a special weekend
discount package is using sales promotion to encourage customers to visit during what might be a slow
time for the hotel. A local newspaper advertisement and a cable television commercial are examples of
traditional advertising rather than sales promotion. A public relations campaign is not sales promotion.

Videos. Many travel agencies are developing displays that include videos to be able to graphically show
people enjoying a destination or participating in a tour. The benefit of using videos is that it enables
potential customers to see what they would see on a tour and to see what they might do at a destination.
The videos are able to show action and excitement and create an atmosphere that attracts customers
and increases sales. For example, a video of people white-water rafting or touring a castle is more
interesting than a simple photograph. A display might include facts, testimonials from satisfied customers,
and sample souvenirs; but these are static parts of a display and do not graphically show people
participating in activities.

Open-ended. An open-ended question requires more than a simple "yes" or "no" response. Assumptive
questions are used when you think you know how customers feel and what they will say. Interpretive
questions help you to understand what the customers have said. An impersonal question would be
unrelated to the customer's preferences.

Experience. Salespeople often try the products they sell in order to acquire product information. They are
able to explain the features and benefits of substitute items based on information they have obtained
from using the items themselves. Salespeople should not let their own personal preferences, opinions,
and feelings influence the product information or suggestions that they give to customers.

"I understand how you feel." Salespeople do not always have to agree with customers, but they should
show that they understand the customers' feelings and appreciate their points of view. With a statement
such as, "I understand how you feel," salespeople can tell customers that they think their objections are
important. As a result, salespeople will probably find that customers will be more open and honest with
them. The other responses do not show empathy with customers' objections.

Feel good about the buying decision. Customers often are not able to make a decision on what they
want, and the salesperson should help them make the buying decision by answering their questions and
providing them with information. Salespeople who answer questions and explain benefits will help
customers to feel good about their decision to buy. Customers should not be rushed into making a quick
decision as this may lead to dissatisfaction later. Salespeople should not leave customers in a state of
indecision or thinking about making a decision.

Team selling. Team selling is a technique that involves putting together a group, or team, of specialists to
sell to a business. Some products are large and complex and require the expertise of several different
specialists to effectively explain their features and benefits. A selling team is able to present a large
amount of information to a potential customer, answer technical questions, and project a strong sales
effort. Mass marketing is designing products and directing marketing activities in order to appeal to the
whole market. Sale pricing is pricing items at low levels and promoting them for a limited period of time.
Retail selling is selling directly to the ultimate consumer.

Location of the property. People travel for many reasons, including business and leisure. The purpose of
the trip, as well as the site location, often influences the selection process. For example, a
businessperson traveling to meet with a customer might select a property close to the customer's office.
A leisure traveler might select a beachfront resort hotel over a nearby roadside motel because it might
offer more amenities geared to vacationers. A trucker, on the other hand, might select the roadside motel
because of its easy access to the highway. Positioning strategies are methods that members of the
hospitality industry use to create a particular image or standing in the marketplace. Although hotels use
positioning strategies to appeal to customers, customers do not generally consider the specific
techniques that businesses use to position products. A traveler selects a lodging facility based on his/her
personal preferences, not the seller's (hotel). Although some travelers might consider tax rates when
selecting a lodging facility, it is usually not a primary factor in the selection process. In addition, lodging
facilities in the same general area most likely have the same tax rates.

To accomplish the business's goals. Management is the logical process of coordinating resources, such
as money and employees, in order to accomplish an organization's goals. Some ways that management
can do this are by obtaining needed resources and creating a good working atmosphere in which workers
can be as productive as possible.
