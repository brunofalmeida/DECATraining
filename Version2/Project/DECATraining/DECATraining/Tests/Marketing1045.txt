Judicial system. The U.S. government consists of three primary partsthe judicial, executive, and
legislative branches. The judicial system (branch) is the court system. The courts interpret and apply the
laws. The president and the presidential cabinet are part of the executive branch of the government. The
legislative branch (i.e., the U.S. Congress) enacts the laws.

Corporation. A corporation, which is owned by its stockholders, limits the losses or risks to the amount
each individual owner has invested in the corporation. The other types of business organizations are not
owned by stockholders. A partnership usually divides the risk among two or three partners. In a sole
proprietorship, the owner generally assumes all of the risk. A franchise is a contractual agreement
between a parent company and a franchisee to distribute goods and services.

Timeliness. Channel management is the process of coordinating channel members to move goods and
services to the end user. The way that a business manages its channel members impacts customerservice
levels. An important aspect of channel management in relation to customer service is making
sure that the customers receive their products in a timely manner. In many cases, customers order items
for a specific purpose and need them on a certain date. Therefore, it is important for the business to
monitor channel members' activities to ensure that the products are moving through the channel in the
most efficient manner. Taxes are monies that individuals or businesses must pay to the government.
Protectionism is a government's policy to protect domestic industries and businesses against foreign
competition. Advertising is any paid form of nonpersonal presentation of ideas, images, goods, or
services.

Promoting products. Channel intermediaries are persons or businesses that perform channel functions in
an indirect channel of distribution. They can be responsible for such marketing functions as buying,
selling, pricing, marking, storing, packaging, promoting, and financing. Recruiting workers for the
business, training employees, and monitoring union activities are human resource activities, not
marketing functions.

5. B
Improves cash flow. For many businesses, the distribution function is expensive to operate because it
involves storing, processing, and transporting products. Oftentimes, businesses bill customers for the
costs involved in distribution and then wait for payment. By using the technology of digital money, cash
can be transferred electronically from the customer's account to the business's account. This improves
cash flow because the business does not need to wait long periods of time for payment. It can receive
cash instantly. The technology of digital money does not increase productivity, create virtual reality, or
manage information.

The manager of a wholesale business awards a supply contract to his/her spouse's company. Awarding
a contract to a company that is owned by a friend or relative might be perceived as a conflict of interest
by others. Distributing product samples to potential customers is a common practice when trying to make
a sale and does not generally illustrate a situation in which ethics are questioned. Negotiating carrier fees
is not considered an unethical situation. Requesting to purchase inventory does not pose an ethical
problem. Many companies have policies regarding employee purchases. Unless the warehouse staff
operates outside the boundaries of the stated policies, the situation is not an ethical issue.

Promotion. Promotion is a marketing function that communicates information about goods, services,
images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome. In order to successfully sell its product, a business
needs to coordinate all the components of marketing, which include distribution, promotion, product, and
price. For example, if a business develops an effective distribution system but fails to promote the
product, customers will not know about the product or want it, although it is readily available. Orientation
is job preparation or induction training for new employees. Production is the creation of goods and
services from economic resources. Competition is the rivalry between two or more businesses to attract
customer dollars.

Bias. Bias is prejudice or partiality that influences a person's perceptions. It is a major block to effective
listening because it affects the way the listener hears what the speaker is trying to say. Feedback is the
response received from another person. Emotion is feeling, and conviction is a firm belief in something.

Find out what other people in the group know about the product. Starting a meeting by learning about
others' knowledge of the subject identifies what your team knowsas well as areas where more work will
be needed. Some ground rules are needed to let everyone know how the group operates. Otherwise,
unacceptable behavior may occur. Unusual ideas should not be avoided. Often these are the
breakthroughs that lead to success. Use good listening skills, including making eye contact and using
other nonverbal cues to let others in the group know you are listening.

It should encourage the reader to take action. Sales-oriented business letters should persuade the reader
to respond by taking whatever action is appropriatereturning a postcard, calling a number, or visiting
the business. The letter should catch the reader's attention in the opening paragraphs. This can often be
accomplished by mentioning a problem the consumer might have that the product being offered can
solve. Sales letters should avoid negative comments about the competition. They should emphasize
product benefits and avoid mentioning price if possible.

Ask questions that can't be answered "yes" or "no." Silent customers are shy, insecure, or too sensitive to
talk very much even when they need help. They are a type of slow/methodical customer, and they require
special handling. The business employee should not do all the talking or wait for the customer to decide
to talk. The employee also should not try to hurry this kind of customer by trying to close quickly. Instead,
s/he should be patient, try to draw the customer out, and try to determine the customer's needs through
appropriate questions.

Consumption. The ultimate goal of all economic activity is consumption, which is the economic process
or activity of using goods and services. For consumption to occur, goods and services must be produced,
or made. Producers, consumers, and resource owners exchange money payments for the use of their
goods, services, and resources. Distribution examines how money payments are divided between
producers and resource owners.

Keep products off the market. If businesses expect prices to increase substantially, they might wait to
sell. That affects supply because businesses are keeping products off the market until the price is right. If
businesses expect prices to increase in the future, they would not increase production now, ship more
products to stores, or encourage consumers to buy.

Relative. Relative prices come into play when both wages and prices rise or fall at the same rate, so that
consumers are willing to pay the new price. Competitive prices are about equal to or lower than those of
a business's competitors. Unfair prices are either too high for the good or service provided, or too low in
comparison to those of competitors. Objective prices are fair and reasonable, relating strictly to the value
of the product.

The business performing the service. Service businesses perform intangible activities that satisfy the
wants of consumers and industrial users. If a good is used in performing the service, its title, or
ownership, is not given to the customers but is retained by the business performing the service. The
customer receives the service, but the business owns the good. For example, a car-rental business
leases the use of a car to a customer for one week. The business owns the car, while the customer
simply buys the use of the car. The business retains ownership of the good, not the producer that made
the good or the supplier that sold the good to the business.

Competition. Competition is the rivalry between two or more businesses to attract scarce customer
dollars. Competition is vital to the successful operation of a private enterprise system because it
encourages people to go into business for themselves and develop the products that consumers want.
Production, mechanization, and distribution take place in the private enterprise system as well as in other
types of economic systems. These activities often are the result of competition because businesses are
constantly trying to improve the way they produce and distribute products in order to attract customers.

Compare their findings to other countries around the world. One of the reasons that countries measure
GDP is to compare their findings to other countries around the world. This lets countries know how they

Cultural sensitivity. Culture is the customs, habits, and traditions of a particular group of people. The way
that different people interact with each other is an expression of their culture. Businesspeople need to be
sensitive to the fact that their foreign customers may have unique customs such as bowing when they
greet each other rather than shaking hands. They should accept these customs and try to make their
foreign customers feel comfortable. Businesspeople who behave in this manner are showing respect for
other customs and habits and are exhibiting cultural sensitivity. Communication skills are abilities to
express yourself clearly and simply. Stereotypical behavior involves acting in a manner that conforms to
a set image. Language differences occur when people speak different languages.

Persuade consumers to buy. Marketers use communication to inform consumers about their goods and

do that, communication must be encoded or presented in a way that will be understood by the target
audience. The form of communication most frequently used by marketers is promotion. Communication is
used to reach a specific market but is not a method of identifying the market.

Installment credit is commonly used to purchase large, expensive items such as cars. The title for an item
purchased on installment credit is made out in the name of the credit user; however, the seller retains a
claim on the title until all of the payments have been made. Regular credit accounts are used to obtain
small-ticket items during a set period of time, usually 30 days. Budget credit accounts advertise credit
terms such as "90 Days Same as Cash." Revolving credit accounts involve setting a credit limit and
paying the amount due each month or making minimum, monthly payments on the account.

Risks. Risks are the possibility of financial loss. One way for businesses to reduce risks is to develop an
efficient system to locate, gather, process, and use information for marketing decisions. Businesses need
information systems for use in decision-making in order to effectively identify alternatives in planning. By
gathering and using information, businesses often are able to recognize trends or potential problems and

Marketing information. Marketing information is all the marketing-related data available from inside and
outside the business. This data includes information about customers, the social and economic

when to develop new products that will meet the changing needs of customers. They also need this
information to decide when to change prices. Businesses that develop new products or change prices
without obtaining current marketing information run the risk of developing products that customers do not
want, or of making price changes that customers will not accept. Promotional research and advertising
data will help businesses decide how to promote and advertise new products. Selling procedures are the
steps that salespeople follow to achieve their goal of making a sale.

Surveying a limited group of similar respondents to represent a broader universe. It is considered
unethical to obtain marketing information from only a limited group of people who have the same opinions
because the results of the survey will be biased. A few researchers collect information in this manner in
order to substantiate a predetermined point of view. This method is unethical because it is not legitimate
research but an attempt to use the predisposed opinions of a few people to support a broad claim. Most
researchers survey a broad range of respondents in order to obtain a variety of opinions. Calling a wide
variety of consumers, interviewing randomly selected participants, and contacting customers in a single
geographic area are ethical methods of collecting marketing information.

geographic location, and send different promotional pieces to each area. The database allows a business
to target specific customers based on certain criteria. Businesses do not use this type of customer
information to prepare financial reports, develop inventory control plans, or maintain sales strategies.

the business's goods and services. Census data, trade-journal articles, and external reports are forms of
secondary research.

presence, actions, or attitudes of the interviewer influence a respondent's answers. The scenario
provides insufficient information to determine whether non-response error occurred. This problem
happens when researchers fail to sample the people who didn't respond to determine whether there were
statistical differences between respondents and non-respondents. Inadequate information is provided to
know whether the question was asked in such a way that it influenced responses.

To improve the effectiveness of salespeople. Sales reports contain a variety of marketing information that
businesses often use to improve the effectiveness of salespeople. This includes information about
number of new customers, number of lost customers, cost of selling, time spent with each customer, etc.
By reviewing the information, a business can determine if the salesperson is effective, or might need
assistance or more training to be better able to market the business's products to customers. For
example, a sales call report might reveal that customers want detailed product information that the
salesperson does not have. Then, the business can develop materials to provide the detailed information.
This will help the salesperson to more effectively work with customers. Businesses do not use the
marketing information contained in sales reports to qualify potential new customers or to develop
negotiating techniques. Expense accounts are types of sales reports that often contain marketing
information.

Key words, query. A search engine is a software program that automatically crawls the Web looking for
information pertaining to specified search terms and then displays a list of results. To conduct an online
search, the employee enters specific or key words (terms, phrases, slang) that pertain to the topic of
interest into the query field and clicks on the search button. The search will provide results that include
the key words in the description. The words entered into the query field should be specific enough to
generate desired results. For example, entering the term, Washington, will likely generate responses
about the U.S. state, the U.S. capital, and the first U.S. president. If the researcher wanted information
about manufacturers in Washington state, entering the words Washington state manufacturers into the
query field would more likely provide the desired results; therefore, the more specific the key words, the
more applicable the results. The field in which a person enters key words is not called a reply, answer, or
subject field. Slang may or may not be a key word.

Tracking deadlines. This activity is important during the planning stages and while the project is being
completed. It is necessary to keep track of due dates and not let the project fall behind schedule. Also,
one part of a project may need to be completed before another part can begin. Project managers make
sure everyone is focusing on the same objective rather than change the objective. Project managers
usually give directions that workers are expected to follow. Effective project managers encourage others
to do their part rather than giving orders.

Inventory of supplies. All businesses need to maintain an inventory of supplies in order to produce goods
and services for customers. Small businesses may only need office supplies while retailers also need
supplies to wrap packages. Large manufacturing businesses need vast inventories of resources to
produce products. Without an inventory of supplies, businesses will not be able to do even simple tasks.
The result might be a loss of customers and a loss of income. Some businesses may need only one
vendor rather than a list of vendors. Businesses do not need to maintain a schedule of accounts or
copies of invoices to produce goods and services for customers.

Update the product. A company's products may need to be updated or changed in order to compete
effectively with similar products produced by other companies. Planning to update a product is part of a
business's production process. Updating a product is less expensive than designing a new product. A
popcorn company may decide to update its popcorn products by adding vitamins or flavorings rather than
spending a lot of money designing completely new products. A business would not produce more
popcorn unless there was an increase in demand. Changing production methods is expensive and would
not necessarily make a business more competitive.

Cost of replacement is less than repair. Companies schedule renovative maintenance to replace
equipment when the cost of repairing that equipment exceeds the cost of replacing it. Renovation could
include replacing heating and cooling systems, office furniture, and operating equipment. If the length of
downtime would be shorter for repairs, it would be better to fix it. This is also true if repair parts are easy
to find or the maintenance staff could easily fix the problem.

Perform job expectations. The ability to perform job expectations and duties may be directly affected by
the lack of exercise, sleep, and adequate relaxation. Employees might not be able to sustain the energy
levels required for many job duties if they are tired, out-of-shape physically, or tense. Lack of exercise,
sleep, or adequate relaxation do not necessarily affect an individual's ability to socialize with coworkers,
enter training programs, or learn of new opportunities.

Analyze the information. Problem solving is finding solutions for problems or obstacles. Although there
are several approaches to problem solving, there are distinct steps that help employees find solutions to
issues or solve work-related problems. First, the employee must define what the problem is. Then, the
employee should state and check any assumptions that s/he might have about the situation. In many
situations, the assumptions are inaccurate or false. After considering assumptions, the employee should
collect the facts. After collecting the facts, the employee can then analyze the facts and determine which
information is meaningful and useful. After analyzing the facts, the employee can come up with ideas to
solve the problem, and then select (make a decision) and implement the best solution.

Nickname. When signing the sections of an employment application that require a signature, applicants
should always use their correct name, not a nickname. A nickname is a familiar form of a proper name
and is generally used only by a person's family and friends. Nicknames are not considered to be
professional and should not be used on applications, which are types of business documents. If an
applicant has a title, such as doctor, it is acceptable to include the title with the signature. An individual's
surname, or last name, is always included in the signature. Applicants should include their initials
because it is possible for several people to have the same first and last names, but they usually have
different middle initials.

Radio. Radio ads are relatively inexpensive compared to the cost of television commercials, magazine

of media, including radio, television, newspapers, magazines, and in some cases, expensive out-of-home
media such as spectaculars, which are built to order.

Price fixing. Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which businesses agree on prices of their
goods or services, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Businesses that discuss their costs,
markups, and prices with competing businesses may be involved in price fixing. In order to avoid possible
price-fixing charges, businesses should not discuss any pricing issues with competitors. Variable pricing
involves changing prices according to demand. Price lining is the practice of selling goods/services at a
limited number of predetermined price points. Flexible pricing involves charging different customers
different prices.

Recession. A recession is a contraction of the GDP (gross domestic product) that lasts at least six
months. During this phase of the business cycle, business activity slows down. As a result,
unemployment occurs and consumers tend to buy less because they have less disposable income, which
lowers demand. In response to lower demand, businesses often reduce their prices in order to survive
until demand increases. Recovery and prosperity are phases of the business cycle that experience an
increase in demand and spending. It is during these phases that demand can exceed supply. As a result,
businesses are more likely to increase their prices. Deflation is not a common term used to describe a
phase in the business cycle.

It reflects the image of the business. The quality level of a product is an important part of product/service
management because it reflects the image of the business. Product managers must choose not only the
image they wish to portray but the level of quality that is appropriate to the products themselves. The way
that a product works refers to its design. By offering warranties, product managers are protecting
consumers. Labels identify a product's brand.

Competitors enter the market. The growth stage is the product life-cycle stage in which sales rise rapidly.
As a result of increased sales, new competitors enter the market to take advantage of the opportunity for
profit. The market continues to expand because the product is popular. During the growth stage, prices
remain the same or are lowered slightly. A fad is a style or design that gains and loses its popularity
within a brief period of time. Promotional budgets remain steady or increase a little to build product
awareness.

To compile customer databases. Businesses often use Internet technology to obtain valuable information
about customers. Today, many businesses maintain web sites that are visited by many users who may
be potential customers. When users visit the sites, the businesses often ask them to register in order to
access the site. Then, the registration process involves answering a series of questions such as name,
street address, e-mail address, personal interests, business associations, etc. The businesses compile
this information into customer databases that they can use to send additional information to those visitors
who fit the criteria of their target markets. Businesses do not use the information that they are able to
obtain due to the advances in Internet technology to develop production systems, interview potential
employees, or prepare operating policies.

Advertising "100% juice" and emphasizing a picture of a fruit other than the one that is the main
ingredient. Advertising "100% juice" and emphasizing a picture of a fruit misleads the consumer into
thinking that the juice is 100% of the pictured fruit. That is considered unethical product labeling if that
fruit is not the main ingredient. It is ethical to list ingredients, vitamins, and the name and address of the
manufacturer.

Brainstorming. Brainstorming is a creative-thinking technique involving the identification of as many
different ideas as possible during a certain time frame. Businesses often have groups of employees meet
to review information in an attempt to identify product opportunities. Sales records are a valuable source
of information to review because they contain information about product returns. Employees can analyze
the reasons for the returns and brainstorm product opportunities that will solve the return problem.
Reviewing a business's sales records for the purpose of identifying product opportunities is not an
example of experimenting, negotiating, or questioning.

Express. An express warranty is a promise expressed in a specific statement concerning the quality of

understood by the consumer and the seller that the product will perform as expected. Not enough
information is given to determine the extent of the promise; therefore, we do not know whether the
promise covered all repairs (a full warranty) or only specific parts of the product (limited warranty).

The Federal Trade Commission Act established the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act bans the production, transportation, and sale of misbranded or adulterated
foods, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices; requires testing of new drugs and generic labeling of all
drugs; sets standards for production and sale of poisonous substances; and sets quality standards for
foods. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires product labels to identify the product, provide the
name and address of the producer or distributor, and describe the contents of the package.

Corporate brand. A corporate brand is the combined impressions, images, or experiences associated
with a company or parent entity. Because a corporate brand may have several different products and/or
product lines under its umbrella, the company may need to appeal to a variety of constituents.
Stakeholders, employees, the media, and its various customers and target markets are a few of the
constituents that the company must consider when it makes business decisions, which affect the
company's overall image. Because the company may have several product lines or companies under the
corporate umbrella (brand), product image, advertising, and assets may vary.

Stealth marketing. Stealth marketing is a deceptive practice in which a business tries to stimulate interest
in a product without disclosing to the public that the business is paying others to create the buzz. When
a company pays a firm to develop and maintain a blog (online journal) about the company's new product
and does not disclose that the blog content is being paid for, the company is being deceptive, which is
unethical behavior. Placement promotion is an advertising technique that involves placing products in
movies, television shows, etc. A sponsorship is an agreement that allows a company to pay a fee for the

Corrective. Corrective advertising explains and amends information that was deceiving in a previous ad.
If a business is found guilty of deceptive advertising, it is often required to develop corrective ads that will
inform consumers about the misleading information and set the record straight. For example, if a
business runs an ad that implies that a product will provide a certain benefit that it cannot provide, the
business may be required to place a corrective ad that explains the inaccurate information. A
comparative ad compares one product to another. Informative and affirmative are not specific types of
advertising.

The clutter in the media. Because more ads are being run, it's easier for an ad to get lost in the clutter.
The high degree of clutter is one of the disadvantages of television advertising. A limitation of television
as a medium is that advertisements do not reach select groups. Anyone who has a television turned on
at the time an ad is run will be exposed to the advertisement. Message impact and interest in ad content
have always been concerns for television advertisers. Shortened messages have not reduced this
concern.

Increased sales. Word-of-mouth communication is promotion and publicity for a business provided by
customers who tell others of their satisfaction with the business. This type of positive communication
often leads to increased sales for the business because it attracts new customers. When satisfied
customers tell others about their positive experiences, they are encouraging others to buy from the
business. This will not decrease advertising costs because the business still needs to advertise.
Advertising is an operating expense. Word-of-mouth communication does not increase the product mix
which is the particular assortment of goods and services that a business offers in order to meet the needs
of its market and its company goals.

Generate an immediate response. A communications channel is a path or means used to provide
information to others. In sales promotion, coupons are a type of communications channel that are used to
provide information about products to customers. The reason for using coupons is to generate an
immediate response by offering reduced prices on specific items. The hope is that customers will be
motivated to buy the product now because of the information they received. Sales promotion is usually
intended to encourage a quick response, while advertising is intended to create long-term demand and
persuade customers to remain loyal. Sales promotion involves promotional activities other than
advertising.

Direct selling. Direct selling involves salespeople calling on customers or potential customers. Small
businesses often do not have a large sales staff which makes it difficult to contact a lot of potential
customers. Participating in trade shows provides an opportunity for small businesses to make contact
with many prospects. This is often a deciding factor when evaluating whether to participate in trade
shows. Once businesses have contacted potential customers, they can begin to build relationships.
Cause marketing involves promoting a cause or social issue. Retailing often involves customers

Target market. Target market is the particular group of customers a business seeks to attract. A
business's target market is an external factor that has an effect on the type of promotional plan the
business develops. If a business's target market is young adults, the business would develop a
promotional plan that appeals to this group. The promotional plan that appeals to young adults might be
very different from the type of plan that appeals to senior citizens. Vendor list, delivery system, and local
media are external factors that do not affect the type of promotional plan that a business develops.

Manufacturers' promotional campaigns. Local businesses are able to gain the benefit of additional
advertising by tying their promotions to the manufacturers' national campaigns. Manufacturers usually

additional advertising without great expense. Competing businesses usually do not coordinate their
promotional efforts. Coordinating a promotion with specials offered at the mall would be effective only if
the business was located in the mall. Taking advantage of the discounts offered by one radio station
would not be an example of coordinating promotional activities.

to maintain the partnerships they have established. This may require only a simple phone call or thankyou

to you and that you appreciate their business. It is important for salespeople to solicit feedback from
customers rather than provide feedback. Salespeople should never be aggressive. Businesses, rather

and conforming.

Lack training in management techniques. Businesses often promote workers to supervisory jobs as a
reward for good performance. These new supervisors often need training to help them assume

done it themselves. Long-range planning involves planning for the entire company and is a responsibility
of top management, not the first-level supervisor. Wanting to move up to mid-level management is not a
problem but a legitimate career goal.
