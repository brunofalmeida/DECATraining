Americans with Disabilities Act. This act protects workers with physical and/or mental disabilities from
discrimination. The law also states that businesses must make reasonable accommodations for disabled
workers unless that puts an undue burden on the business. Reasonable accommodation involves making
adjustments so that qualified individuals can perform the necessary job activities. For example,
reasonable accommodation might include modifying work schedules so disabled employees could arrive
and depart at different times if they relied on special bus service to transport them to work. There is an
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but not an Equal Employment Opportunity Act. The Civil
Rights Act of 1991 expanded previous civil rights legislation by allowing employees who feel they have
been the victims of discrimination to sue their employers. The Occupational Safety and Health Act
stipulates that workers may not be disciplined or discharged for refusing to work in unsafe environments
or because they report an alleged violation to the appropriate government agency.

Critical feedback. When bank employees present their ideas to management or coworkers, they should
be prepared to defend those ideas and provide supporting information. They also should be willing to
accept critical feedback because others might not agree with the ideas or have different opinions. Being
prepared will help employees remain objective and be able to offer logical evidence to back up their
ideas. Critical feedback is often useful because it allows employees to view their ideas from a different
perspective. Defending ideas usually does not involve accepting additional responsibility or nonverbal
support. It is not acceptable to attack employees on a personal level because of their ideas.

Repeat business. Salespeople who develop positive relationships with customers usually are able to
maintain those customers over a period of time. The benefit of having positive customer relationships is
repeat business. Salespeople know that it is more time consuming and expensive to attract new
customers than it is to keep existing customers. Therefore, salespeople try to build good relationships
with their customers in order to keep their business. Positive customer/client relations do not result in
more competition, additional stress, or increased training.

Offering to find information for customers. Bank employees often need to communicate information to
customers in order to provide service. On occasion, employees may not know the answer to a customer's
question, but instead of saying they do not know, they should offer to find out. Obtaining information for
customers is an effective way of reinforcing a service orientation through communication. Employees
should help all customers rather than be selective about who they serve. Employees should never tell
customers that they are misinformed. Employees should be tactful when dealing with complaints because
customers are not always right.

United States, the government allows some monopolies to exist under controlled conditions. This
happens when legislators feel that one large company can more efficiently serve consumers than several
small ones. For example, many utility companies are regulated monopolies and operate under close
state and federal supervision. The government knows the companies exist, yet it does not own them.
Indirect competitors are business rivals which offer dissimilar goods or services.

Input price increases. Economies of scale are a condition that occurs when a business's input increases
by a certain percentage (e.g., 50%), which results in a larger percentage increase of output (e.g., 100%),
causing the cost of each unit that is produced to decrease. A barrier to economies of scale occurs when
the cost of the resources that the business needs to produce the goods increases. When resource costs
increase, the cost to produce each unit also increases. Fewer competitors, accounting practices, and
pricing strategies do not directly affect a business's actual production activities in relation to the
economies of scale.

Cyclical. Cyclical unemployment occurs when spending decreases and a country is heading into a
recession. This is a serious economic problem because many people are out of work, which means that
consumer spending will continue to decline. The more spending decreases, the more workers become
unemployed because production also decreases. If countries are not able to stop the cycle, it often leads
to a depression. Structural unemployment occurs when the types of jobs change and employees need
new skills. Frictional unemployment occurs when workers are between jobs or changing jobs. Seasonal
unemployment occurs when jobs change due to the time of year.

Economic interdependence. Countries are interdependent because they need imports essential to the
welfare of their citizens, and they need exports to provide opportunities for employment. A comparative
advantage results when one country has an advantage over others in the production of a good or
service. When exports exceed imports, a country experiences a trade surplus; when imports are greater
than exports, a country experiences a trade deficit.

Role of women. The role of women in a country often has an impact on financial institutions doing
business with that country. In some countries, women have very few opportunities to work and do not
participate in business activities. Therefore, many businessmen in these countries are not accustomed to
working with women. In other societies, women have equal opportunities and participate in business on
the same level with men. Financial institutions need to be aware of the role of women in other countries
in order to avoid creating problems or offending their customers. The source of income, type of climate,
and variety of industry are not social and cultural characteristics of foreign countries.

Sales presentation. Businesses use persuasion in a variety of sales situations, including sales
presentations and letters. The purpose of a sales presentation is to persuade a customer or potential
customer to buy the business's goods or services. To do this effectively, the business identifies the
customer's needs and uses techniques to appeal to those needs. For example, an effective sales
presentation might identify a specific problem and persuade the customer that the business has the best
solution to the problem. A job application and an interview session are situations in which employees or
potential employees use persuasion. Classroom instruction is intended to teach rather than persuade.

Personality. Personality is an individual's qualities or traits and behavior. Some employees often
experience more stress because of their personalities. For example, employees who are extremely
competitive and strive for perfection all the time may experience more stress than employees who are
more easygoing and relaxed. If employees realize that their personalities are causing them stress, they
may be able take measures to control the stress. Headaches and anxiety are often symptoms of stress.

The resources that you will need. Vision is the future you desire to create and involves making positive
changes to make it happen, which requires determination and hard work. A vision for the future begins
with a general or broad view of a desired outcome, such as helping sick children or ending world hunger.
Once you determine your vision, you must figure out what resources you will need to carry out the vision,
such as money (financial considerations), training (education and skills), and volunteers (human
resources). Personal financial goals may not affect how you carry out your vision. Volunteers give their
time freely, so they are not hired (paid) employees. A mission statement is a brief summary of what a
business owner wants a business to be doing. Mission statements often change over time, but vision
statements remain the same.

Industry trends. An industry trend is the direction in which a particular industry is moving. The
combination of financial information with industry trends helps businesses to estimate the amount of cash
flow necessary to continue operations and increase profits. If industry trends indicate that conditions are
favorable for sales to remain strong, then a business might estimate that its cash flow from sales will
increase. Future earnings and potential costs are what a business is predicting with the help of
information about industry trends. Businesses use all available information in an effort to set realistic
goals.

$33,195. Cash flow is the movement of funds into and out of a business and determines the amount of
cash the business has to work with at any given time. Cash flow is calculated by subtracting the amount
of cash going out of the business (expenses) from the amount coming into the business (receipts). In this
example, subtract the operating expenses from the cash receipts ($345,675 - $312,480 = $33,195). The
taxes are included in the operating expenses and not subtracted separately.

as discounts that are available if the customer pays within a certain amount of time. In this example, the

the discount, multiply the net amount by 4% ($3,675.50 x 4% or .04 = $147.02). Subtract this figure from
the net amount to calculate the total after discount ($3,675.50 - $147.02 = $3,528.48).

budget projects the amount of money needed to operate the business over a certain period of time. It

revenue should be more than the projected expenses in order to have a balanced operating budget. The
operating budget does not project turnover in employees, charges for goods or services, or taxes.

16%. Businesses often calculate profitability based on the relationship between net profit and net sales in
order to determine if they are earning an acceptable return on their investment. One formula for
calculating the profitability ratio is net profit divided by net sales ($125,000 ÷ $775,000 = .161 or 16%).
Businesses track this ratio from year to year in order to determine if profits are increasing or decreasing
in proportion to sales. If sales increase but the profitability ratio decreases, the business knows that it is
spending too much on the sales effort and may need to reduce costs or increase prices.

statement, the business determines the number of hours of labor and multiplies the time by the hourly
billing rate. If there are 25 hours of labor and the hourly billing rate is $35, the client's statement will
indicate a charge of $875. Monthly salary, overhead expense, and profit margin are factors that a
business might consider when determining the hourly billing rate to charge for labor.

Interest rates. Businesses often need to raise additional capital, or funds, to cover unexpected expenses
or to make large investments. One way to raise capital is to obtain a bank loan. However, before
obtaining a loan, businesses should consider the interest rates that they will be charged for the use of
those funds. If the current interest rate is high and a business needs a five-year loan, the overall cost of
the capital also will be high. Businesses may decide that the costs are too high and look for other ways to
raise capital. Businesses usually do not pay legal fees when raising capital by obtaining a bank loan.

Cash flow. Cash flow is the movement of funds into and out of a business. When evaluating future cash
flow, businesses often estimate the income they might receive as a result of investments. For example, if
a business receives dividends from stocks and bonds, the business has additional cash flowing into the
business on a regular basis. By estimating the expected return on investments, a business can determine
if it will have sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses or expand the business. Depreciation is the
reduction in value of goods occurring over a period of time. A liability is a debt. A business estimating the
expected return on investments is not evaluating future sales risk.

Access cash quickly. Businesses acquire a variety of assets over a period of time. These assets include
equipment, property, investments in other companies, and cash. When determining the optimal mix and
type of assets to acquire, businesses consider their long-term financial needs because certain
investments increase in value over time and add to the net worth of the business. Businesses also
consider the need to access cash quickly because some assets are easier to convert to cash than others.
For example, savings accounts are assets that businesses can access quickly in order to obtain cash.
Businesses want to develop the right mix of assets so they can access cash when necessary and also
increase their net worth. Property is an asset. Not all businesses issue stock dividends, but if they do,
dividends are expenses paid to others. Businesses do not determine the optimal mix and type of assets
to acquire in order to calculate income taxes.

Leverage. Businesses often use leverage to increase their assets. This involves borrowing money to
make an investment that generates more income than the interest it pays on the borrowed money. For
example, a business borrows $50,000 to purchase stock in another company. The business pays back
the loan with interest over a two-year period for a total of $60,000. However, at the end of two years, the
stock in the other company is valued at $80,000. The business has leveraged the $50,000 loan into an
$80,000 investment. If it sells the stock, the business will have additional income of $20,000 after paying
the $10,000 in interest. Although the business is increasing its assets, this is not considered an example
of expansion. Equity is the net worth of the business. Liquidity is the ability to convert assets to cash.

Preferred cash balance. Businesses usually establish a preferred cash balance which is the amount of
cash that the business always wants to have on hand. Cash in excess of that amount is available for the
business to spend. If the business estimates that it will have expenses that will cost more than the
available cash, it usually decides to begin financing activities in order to borrow money and maintain the
preferred cash balance. When deciding when to spend cash, businesses usually do not consider the
estimated capital budget, projected interest rate, or required loan schedule.

52. B
Needed cash. Factoring is a type of debt financing that involves selling accounts receivable for a
discounted amount to another company. The factoring company buys a business's accounts receivable
for less than they are worth and then collects the receivables. The business that sells its accounts
receivable receives needed cash quickly rather than waiting for customers to pay their accounts. Some
businesses factor accounts receivable if they are experiencing a cash-flow problem and need to obtain
cash. Trade credit is another type of debt financing, but it does not involve factoring accounts receivable.
Equity financing involves selling part of the ownership of a business to acquire capital. Leverage is
borrowing money to acquire an asset that will have more value than the cost of borrowing the money.

Short-term investments. A characteristic of marketable securities is that they are short-term investments
that businesses usually intend to sell within a year. They are temporary investments that many
businesses make when they have excess cash that they do not need to spend in the near future. The
benefit of investing in marketable securities, such as government bonds or stock in other companies, is
that the business can sell them quickly and easily to obtain cash. Marketable securities are investments
rather than liabilities or debts. They are short-term investments rather than long-term assets.

businesses also need to develop projected financial plans in order to be prepared to fund the operations.
If the size of the company will double, then there will be additional expenses to pay. The business must
plan to pay those expenses. When projecting future operations, businesses do not develop projected tax
schedules, stock options, or inventory methods.

Pay operating expenses. Businesses monitor cash flow in order to make sure there are sufficient funds
coming into the business to pay expenses, such as operating costs. Many businesses know the
approximate amount of expenses they need to pay each month. Therefore, they may set up payment
schedules to coincide with cash flowing into the business. Also, they may offer discounts to customers to
encourage them to pay earlier in order to increase cash flow. The goal is to maintain a positive cash flow
to cover expenses. Businesses may make investments, declare dividends, or award employee bonuses if
the business shows a sufficient amount of profit. However, these activities are not necessarily tied to
cash flow.

Analyzing variances. Standard costs are those costs that should be incurred if activities take place under
normal circumstances. Businesses use standard costs as a benchmark when comparing costs to
determine if actual costs varied from the standard. This process is known as analyzing variances. For
example, if actual costs are higher than standard costs, a variance exists. This might indicate a problem
that the business should identify and correct in order to bring actual costs in line with standard costs.
Comparing standard costs with actual costs is not an example of calculating expenses, estimating
payables, or predicting returns.

Current financial data. Corporations usually are required to prepare quarterly reports that contain current
financial information. By preparing quarterly reports, corporations are able to analyze the current financial
condition of the business and make adjustments if needed. Also, this information tells stockholders if their
investment is growing in value or if it is time to sell. Corporations analyze current financial data when
preparing quarterly reports rather than investment options, collection procedures, or inventory systems.

On revenues that have been invoiced, but that have not yet been received. The accrual method closely
matches revenues and expenses to the actual period in which the transactions occur, regardless of when
cash actually changes hands. Although the accrual method provides a more accurate view of the
company's financials, there is also the drawback of having to pay income tax on revenues that have been
invoiced, but not yet received. Expected revenues from orders that have been placed are not recognized
until the product or service has been delivered, and therefore are not subject to tax. Tax is paid on cash
actually received under a cash accounting method, not accrual. Income tax is paid according to the
accounting method a business owner selects at the outset and not according to a separate set of
financial records.

Employee to customer ratio. Investment businesses usually consider a variety of factors when
determining hiring needs because they want to hire the right number of employees. One important factor
is the employee to customer ratio, particularly for businesses that interact directly with customers. For
example, a business decides that it should have one employee per 10 customers. As the business
estimates its rate of growth, it realizes it will need to hire additional employees to maintain the desired
ratio. Qualifications of staff are considered when deciding whether to recruit internally. The type of
application is not a factor. Bonuses for outstanding performance are given to employees rather than
customers.

use the resume as the basis for obtaining additional information. During the interview, an applicant may
be asked to provide additional references. Orientation occurs after an applicant has been hired. Current
employees, rather than job applicants, are evaluated.

need to spend their own money to buy the insurance. Benefits that employees receive do not increase
their value to the business, tax liability, or financial obligation.

expected to stop working and give the auditors access to their records and equipment. In most cases,
tellers are expected to remain at their stations to answer questions, if necessary. However, they are not
expected to point out problem areas because identifying errors is the job of the auditors. Audits are
required in the banking industry, and banks expect tellers to cooperate fully. Tellers do not verify cash
drawer amounts during an audit.

determine the current monthly rent by multiplying the square feet by the rental rate (2,225 x $2.30 =
$5,117.50). Then, multiply that amount by 12 to determine the current yearly rent ($5,117.50 x 12 =
$61,410). Finally, multiply the current rent by the 3% increase to determine the amount of increase and
add the increase to the current rent to determine next year's rent ($61,410 x 3% or .03 = $1,842.30;

$12,600. Businesses use budget information to monitor sales and expenses and to compare budgeted
amounts with actual figures. If sales increase over the amount budgeted and expenses remain steady,
the business's income will also increase. In this example, the business's actual sales increased over the
budgeted amount. To calculate the increase in income, first determine the budgeted four-month sales
total ($165,500 x 4 = $662,000). Then, calculate the amount of that figure that was budgeted for
expenses ($662,000 x 55% or .55 = $364,100). Then, subtract budgeted expenses from budgeted sales
to calculate budgeted income ($662,000 - $364,100 = $297,900). Next, calculate the amount of expenses
based on actual sales ($690,000 x 55% or .55 = $379,500). Subtract expenses from actual sales to
calculate actual income ($690,000 - $379,500 = $310,500). To determine the increase in income,
subtract budgeted income from actual income ($310,500 - $297,900 = $12,600).

then may schedule the remainder of their work day around the core hours. Some employees may choose
to come in early and leave when core time ends, or come in when core time begins and leave later in the

Actual sales are 75% of estimate. One of the purposes of developing a business plan that includes
monthly sales goals is to provide the company with a tool for tracking its progress. An effective business
plan includes a way to measure performance on a regular basis rather than waiting until the end of the
year to find out if the goals have been met. Many plans contain monthly sales goals which can be
compared to actual sales to determine if the business is on track or needs to make adjustments. If actual
sales are only 75% of the monthly goal, the business will want to make changes to improve its
performance. A business plan might set the same sales goals for several consecutive months. Business
plans usually take into consideration seasonal fluctuations in sales. Each salesperson might have a
monthly sales quota, which usually is set by the sales manager based on the goals outlined in the
business plan.
