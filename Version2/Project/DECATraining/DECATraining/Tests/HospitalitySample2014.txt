Contracts. Business torts are wrongful actions against a business that cause it harm in some way.
Disputes concerning contracts are often the basis for businesses suing individuals or other businesses.
Many businesses have contractual arrangements with employees or vendors. If these contracts are
broken, the business might be harmed and seek compensation through the legal system. Basic torts
relating to businesses do not involve disputes concerning assaults, defamation, or emotional stress.

Enforce agency regulations. Administrative law deals with the rules and regulations that have been
established by governmental agencies. Government and independent agencies have the authority to
enact and enforce regulations for various administrative functions, including aviation, taxation, and
commerce. The legislative branch of government establishes congressional/parliamentary committees.
The judicial branch of government interprets constitutional law and in some instances may overturn a
lower court's judicial decision.

Direct. In direct distribution, the marketing functions are performed by the producers without the
assistance of intermediaries. Indirect channels utilize intermediaries between producers and consumers
to aid in the movement of products. Both of these types of channels are satisfactory and not unusual, but
they are referred to as direct or indirect.

Gray marketing. Gray market goods are foreign-made products that are imported into countries by
suppliers that are not authorized by the manufacturers. The distribution of gray market goods bypasses
the authorized distribution channels, which enables them to sell the goods at low prices. Businesses that
buy gray market goods for resale often charge discounted prices. This practice has a negative effect on
authorized dealers that purchased the same goods from the manufacturers and are not able to offer large
discounts. Sale pricing is pricing items at low levels and promoting them for a limited period of time.
Personal selling is the form of promotion that determines client needs and wants and responds through
planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and enhances future business
opportunities. Volume buying involves buying in large quantities, which often results in receiving a
discount.

Take notes while reading. Employees often are expected to read a wide variety of materials to obtain
information that they can use on the job or to help the company. Some of this material may be complex,
technical, and difficult to understand. To extract relevant information effectively, it is often useful to take
notes while reading. Jotting down key points or summarizing helps employees to focus on the information
and remember it. It may not be possible to ask frequent questions when reading. Outlines are developed
before writing begins. Skimming through chapter titles is not an effective way to extract information.

Make comments such as “yes” or “I see” occasionally. When someone talks to you, nod and make short
comments such as “yes” or “I see” occasionally. By doing so, you signal that you are listening to the
speaker and hearing what s/he has to say. And, when you nod and make short comments, you show
your support and encouragement for the speaker. It is very rude to interrupt the speaker to debate what
s/he has said. It is not necessary to clap as the speaker makes each of her/his main points. Rather than
not making any noise while the speaker is talking, you should limit yourself to short comments.

Practice active listening. This means asking questions and restating what the speaker has said in order

the listener can concentrate on what is being said.

customers for asking about the business and its products. And, by encouraging the customer to ask
additional questions, the employee is indicating his/her interest in the customer. There is not enough
information in the example to determine if the customer placed an order, had a problem with an invoice,
or requested product color information. The sentence, "Reply by e-mail with the color that you want,"
could be interpreted as rude and unprofessional.

Information will be needed later. In many situations, the information provided during meetings or

will have access to the information in the future. For example, participants may need to write a summary
of the meeting to give to supervisors. If the speaker is difficult to understand, participants should ask
questions. The audience does not take notes to have something to do. Writing does not necessarily keep

Appropriate way to cite his resources. To provide consistency throughout written documents, certain
businesses or industries often follow a specific writing style, such as Associated Press (AP) or Chicago

the appropriate style manual to ensure that s/he is formatting a resource citation correctly. A computersoftware
manual, the computer-software "help" function, or a computer-software website provides
information about setting up tables in documents. A dictionary or glossary provides formal definitions of

Aligning business activities with customer needs. A customer-centric business focuses on customer
needs and wants. To focus on the customers' needs and wants, the business must ensure that its
business objectives and activities align with its customers' needs and wants. A customer-centric business
must continuously improve its processes and products to accommodate its customers' changing needs
and wants—the business cannot be satisfied with the status quo. A customer-centric business allows its
employees to provide input and make decisions in relation to customer relationships. Touch points are all
of the opportunities that businesses have to connect with customers and reinforce their brand value. A
customer-centric business is not likely to reduce the number of customer touch points.

Consumers can buy quality products at competitive prices. Businesses that are socially responsible focus

It can create better customer experiences. Because of its specific focus, the divisional organizational
structure can create better experiences for customers. For instance, a customer question or complaint
made in a certain territory can go directly to that territory's manager instead of national headquarters. The

economy is that individuals and businesses can use their skills and other resources to compete with
other individuals and businesses for scarce consumer dollars. A communist command economy is a
command economic system in which the government controls the economic system and does not allow
private ownership of resources and production. Imperialism occurs when one territory or country takes
control, often by force, of the political and economic system of another territory or country. An

An unfavorable balance of trade. The difference between a country's imports and its exports is known as
the balance of trade. An unfavorable balance of trade occurs when a nation's imports are greater than its
exports. This trade deficit decreases the gross domestic product and can lead to a lower standard of
living. An increase in exports has a positive effect on the gross domestic product, as does a limitation on
imports. A strong U.S. dollar increases imports and discourages exports, which is harmful to domestic

Stocks. Stocks, mutual funds, real estate, and collectibles are moderate- and high-risk ownership
investments that provide opportunities for return by letting you own something of significance. A stock is
a piece of paper—whether real or virtual—that says you own part of a corporation. As an owner (or
shareholder), you have the rights and responsibilities of ownership. You may be able to sell your stocks
for a profit, making a sizeable sum of money. But, being an owner means you risk losing money, too, if
the corporation suffers financially or goes out of business. Bonds, savings accounts, and certificates of
deposit are lending investments. With a lending investment, you allow someone to borrow your money for
a period of time—for a price. The extra money you receive provides the motivation for lending. Investors
who can't handle much risk put their money into lending investments. Since Logan is willing to accept a

many types of risk such as property damage. For example, if a business facility is vandalized, insurance
will pay for the repairs. Coverage is the amount an insurance company will pay for a loss. Injury and

Virtual private network. Software refers to the programs that instruct computers to perform specific
operations. Software that instructs the computer to transfer certain information to specific computer
systems through a secure Internet exchange is a virtual private network (VPN). When channel members'
computer systems are linked together by this type of software, the necessary information (e.g., purchase
orders) can be transferred quickly from one channel member to another, which increases the efficiency of
the entire distribution process. An Intranet software system allows information flow among a company's
employees. An Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides access to the Internet, usually
for a fee. A client network refers to a client, usually a business, which has its own Intranet.

Demographic. Demographic trends refer to the physical and social characteristics of a population. Where
people live and their ethnic backgrounds are demographic characteristics. For example, there is a
growing trend towards urbanization, which means that more and more people are living in cities rather
than in rural areas. Also, the population of many areas is becoming more multicultural, or made up of
many different ethnic groups. Businesses consider demographic trends because they realize that
changes in the population have an effect on how they market their goods and services to customers.
Although where customers live may affect the environment, it's not an environmental trend. Likewise,
where customers live can affect their access to technology; however, it is not a technical trend. Cultural
trends would involve long-term changes to people's values and beliefs. They do not relate to the ages of
people.

Report workplace accidents. Certain governmental agencies have developed health and safety
regulations that businesses are expected to follow in order to provide employees with a safe work
environment. These regulations usually require businesses to report workplace accidents to the
appropriate agency. The purpose of this requirement is to identify and correct unsafe working conditions,
and to compensate workers who have been injured on the job. Health and safety regulations usually do
not require businesses to inspect office facilities, hold regular safety meetings, or purchase fireproof
supplies. However, safety-conscious businesses usually inspect their facilities to identify potential safety
hazards. Also, businesses often hold regular safety meetings to keep employees informed.

Average product usage amount per month. Businesses need office supplies to operate efficiently. The
types and quantities of supplies vary by business. To determine the optimal level of inventory to keep on
hand, Claire needs to first determine the average amount of the product used for a certain time period,
such as a month. For example, if the business goes through two cases of copy paper in June and three
cases in July and four cases in August, the average or optimal amount to keep on hand is three cases of
copy paper. By determining an average usage amount of routine supplies, the business does not tie up
funds by purchasing too many items or risk running out of the items. Employees' preferences, the
budgeting method, and the vendors' daily sales promotions are not primary considerations when
determining the optimal level of supplies that the business should keep on hand.

An advertising manager corrects a copywriter's ad copy. An important aspect of quality control is

Concept mapping. Concept mapping is a method of clarifying and organizing ideas by using a graphic
format to show relationships. This technique involves drawing a map of your ideas so that you can see
how one idea relates to another. Concept mapping can be used for developing ideas for many purposes,
but it is especially useful for project planning. After you get your ideas down on paper, color-coding your
notes can help you see how your thoughts fit together. Redefining involves looking at a problem from a
different angle if no solution seems apparent. Ambiguities are words or phrases with either a double
meaning or a doubtful meaning.

Future outlook. When researching employment opportunities in business, it is important to consider the
future outlook for the type of career. Some careers in certain industries are growing and the future is
good. However, careers in other industries are declining. Individuals should find out if there is growth
potential or if a job will be phased out over the next few years. An example is an increase in service jobs
but a decrease in manufacturing jobs. Vacation time and safety programs vary from business to business
and are not major considerations when researching employment opportunities. The office environment is
unique to each business. Individuals usually learn about the environment once they begin a job.

The resume contains misspelled words. Mistakes on job resumes often indicate to personnel directors
that the applicants are careless and would continue that habit on the job. Applicants who provide errorfree
resumes are viewed more favorably by personnel directors and often have a better chance of finding
jobs. Resumes and cover letters are often sent via email, so cover letters often do not include applicant's
handwritten signature. Often, businesses want professional references rather than personal references.
In many situations, references are not required until the applicant passes the initial screening process. A
college degree does not ensure that the applicant will not make mistakes on the job.

A decrease in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available. A decrease in the
number of guests occurs during economic slowdowns because people are reluctant to spend their
discretionary income on travel. Consequently, there is an increase in the number of rooms available as
more rooms become available for rent. An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the
number of rooms available does not follow the law of supply and demand, which suggests that as
demand for rooms go up, supply typically goes down. A decrease in the number of guests and a
decrease in the number of rooms available would work the other way because as demand goes down,
the supply of rooms available for rent typically goes up. An increase in the number of guests and a
decrease in the number of rooms available typically occurs during good economic times when people are
more willing to spend their discretionary income on travel.

Negotiable. The hospitality industry experiences fluctuations in demand for hotel accommodations.
Supply and demand fluctuations occur for many reasons. For example, seasonal factors affect how
resorts price their rooms. They often charge higher prices during typical vacation times because more
people are traveling and need sleeping accommodations. Room prices are also affected by the economy.
When the economy is good, more people take vacations and more organizations hold off-site business
meetings. This creates a higher demand, which lowers the availability of hotel rooms. When people are
traveling less, there is a decrease in demand and an increase in room availability. When this occurs,
guests can often negotiate lower prices for the guest rooms. The hotels are willing to negotiate so that
rooms do not go unoccupied, which is a financial loss for the hotels. Hotel room prices are not consistent,
classified, or imprecise as a result of changes in supply and demand.

A warranty is a promise made by the seller to the buyer that the seller will repair or replace a product that
does not perform as expected. Testimonials and warranties may facilitate the buying decision; however,
these options do not allow buyers (purchasing managers) to inspect products firsthand. When a desired
item is not available, a vendor may suggest a substitute item that is similar to the item originally
requested. A buyer may want to inspect a substitute product before purchasing it; however, there is not
enough information provided to indicate that the purchasing manager is requesting samples of a
substitute product.

publicity and decide to do business with them rather than with their competitors. Businesses often

business to test new products, nor does it necessarily make it possible for customers to meet top
management.

E-mail. Direct marketing messages can be communicated to consumers via many different media,
including e-mail, direct mail, website, television, radio, print, etc. A company website or television, radio,
and print advertisements are useful when communicating with a relatively broad target market. Direct
mail, on the other hand, allows marketers to target a more specific group of individuals, based on the fact
that advertisements can be sent directly to certain people's homes. However, given the fact that the
company plans to communicate with this list of interested individuals on a weekly basis, direct mail would
become costly. Provided that the interested individuals have given Smoky Mountain Cabin Rentals
specific permission to send advertisements via e-mail, weekly promotional e-mails would probably be the

inform, persuade, or remind customers of their products. Institutional promotion is a type of promotion
that aims to create a certain image of the company in the eyes of the consumer. Participating in
community outreach activities often generates publicity, which benefits the businesses. Businesses are
often recognized by the media for their participation, so people in the community become aware of the
businesses and their community involvement. This reminds people of the businesses and often
encourages them to become customers because the businesses are supportive of the community.
Participating in community outreach activities is not considered a form of customer service or target
marketing. Product promotion is a form of promotion that aims to persuade consumers to buy a good or
service.

Texture. Texture refers to the surface characteristic of a good or display prop, and may be described as
shiny, dull, smooth, or rough. The use of different types of textures in displays creates contrast and draws
attention to the main item on display. For example, shiny smooth goods become more prominent when
displayed against a contrasting dull rough background. Balance and harmony are principles of display
design rather than elements of design. Distance is not an element of design.

Package. These arrangements can consist of anything from sports packages, to theater, to getaway
weekends. A group plan is when a hotel gives discounts for large groups of people staying at the hotel. A
budget plan covers the costs of operating the hotel. An advertising plan is a plan to promote the hotel.

"Brand X is on sale today." This is an example of a merchandise approach—a comment or question that
helps direct the customer's attention to the merchandise. It usually refers to goods on display in which the
customer seems to be showing an interest. The other alternatives are different versions of the greeting,
or welcome, approach—a warm, friendly greeting that makes the customer feel welcome and important.

Tell others about the business. It is important to serve customers well so that they will tell others about
the good service. Selling appropriate products to satisfy their particular needs is one way of creating
good feelings among customers and improving the company's reputation. Satisfied customers will
continue to use the company and not take their business elsewhere. Having a positive feeling about a
company does not affect the decision to return items for credit. Satisfied customers do not expect
discounts on future sales.

"This tie matches your shirt." Suggestion selling is a sales technique in which the salesperson attempts to
increase the customer's purchase by suggesting additional products after the original decision to buy has
been made. Suggesting a tie that matches a shirt may lead the customer to buy both. Saying which tie
appeals to the salesperson is simply voicing an opinion. The other alternatives present features of the
ties.

Recommendations of friends. People often rely heavily on the recommendations of friends, relatives, and
associates when choosing travel destinations. When friends share information about good experiences
on cruise ships or on escorted tours, they often encourage each other to take similar trips. People may
assume that they and their friends have similar likes and dislikes and would enjoy the same travel
destinations. People usually do not select a destination if their friends had a bad experience and do not
recommend it. People are not motivated to choose travel destinations because of the methods of
promotion, actions of competitors, or level of maintenance.
