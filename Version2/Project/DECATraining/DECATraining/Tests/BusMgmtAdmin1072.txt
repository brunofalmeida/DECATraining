MON Company. The debtor is the individual or business that owes money to another individual or
business, which is the creditor. In the situation presented, MON Company is the creditor because the
company has the finances to extend credit to Mrs. Jones (the debtor), allowing her to pay later. Pedro
Sanchez is an employee of the creditor. The location of the company is not a factor in determining the
debtor-creditor relationship.

Asking for clarification. Effective listeners give full attention to what is being said and ask questions to
make sure that they understand the message. Listeners who interrupt are focusing on themselves rather
than the speaker. Judging the speaker's appearance distracts the listener from what is being said.
Thinking of what to say next instead of listening to what is being said is a common barrier to effective
communication.

Follow-up with the customer after obtaining the requested information. When employees do not know the
answer to their customers' questions, they should take steps to get the answers. This often involves
researching the problem or issue. When extensive research is required, an employee should obtain the
customer's contact information and call him/her back with the requested information after the research
has been completed. The nature of the inquiry determines if literature should be sent to the customer or if
another employee or manager should answer the customer's inquiry. For example, a question about a bill
may be better answered by an accounts-receivable employee than a purchasing agent. And, in this
situation, it would be inappropriate to send product information.

5. A
Information is complex. In some situations, it is difficult to give effective verbal directions. One situation is
if the information is complex. Managers sometimes make the mistake of believing that all directions can
be given verbally. However, if the information is complex and requires an extensive explanation, it may
be better to provide verbal directions as well as written instructions or diagrams. If the complex

No paragraph indents. Many businesses use the full-block method to format business letters. All
components of the letter (date, address, greeting, body, closing, signature block) use left justification,
which means all text is aligned on the left side of the margin. Writers using the full-block format do not
indent the first sentence of each paragraph. Other formatting characteristics of full-block letters are the
use of single-spacing within the paragraphs and the use of double-spacing between the paragraphs.

letters should contain contact information—the inquirer's name, telephone number, mailing address,
and/or e-mail address. Skills and qualifications might be included in a letter of inquiry that a job seeker
sends to a potential employer. Project specifications might be included in a request for proposal. Letters

Receptive. An analytical report is a document that explains and evaluates an issue, opportunity, or
problem. Often, the analytical report includes recommendations for a business to take a certain course of
action. If the writer anticipates that most members of the audience are receptive and will agree with the
recommendations, then using a direct approach to structure the report is optimal. The direct approach
involves writing the report so it focuses the attention on the conclusions and recommendations. If the
writer anticipates a skeptical, argumentative, or indecisive audience, the indirect approach may be the
best way to structure the report. The indirect approach involves preparing a logical argument that
supports the recommendations and focuses on the rationale behind the recommendations. Intellect refers
to a person's level of understanding about a topic or concept, which varies per person and is not
necessarily related to the structure of the report.

Employees' gestures and facial expressions convey their attitudes, which customers often believe is a
reflection of the business's attitudes. Because Molly nodded and maintained eye contact with Ms. West
while she was explaining a computer problem, Molly was indicating that she was listening and willing to

Managing your commitments in a timely manner means that you allow yourself enough time to complete

the situation is to suggest they meet for lunch between the airport and Jana's office at 1:15. This way, if
Jana's meeting with her boss goes a few minutes longer than expected, she still has time to arrive for her
meeting with Susan on time. Susan will have a rental car, so transportation is not an issue for her. It may
not be convenient for Susan to meet with Jana the following week. Because Susan arrives at 11:30 a.m.

Comparing and ordering concepts. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight,
and information of internal and external resources to help an organization achieve its goals. An important
aspect of knowledge management involves capturing the expertise, insight and information, so the
business can use it in meaningful ways. A business can use many different tools to capture knowledge in
an organization. Sorting techniques allow the business to compare all of the data and information that it
has collected, categorize it, and place it in a meaningful order or sequence. This process allows the
business to look at all of the knowledge that it has gathered in different ways. This often helps the
business determine efficiencies and inefficiencies within the business. Sorting techniques often help a
business determine if any of the information that it has collected is confidential or relevant. After sorting
and analyzing the information, the business may decide to take corrective action by changing some of its
objectives.

Annabelle calls on her customers to determine if they need additional products. A company should
communicate its business goals to its employees, so the employees understand how their work
contributes to the company's growth and well-being. A sales goal is just one of many types of company
goals. Sales are critical to the company's financial well-being because they generate income and profit
for the company. Annabelle is taking action to increase sales because she is calling on her customers
with the goal of making sales that meet their needs. Kevin is advising a customer about a policy change.
Although Nancy is taking advantage of lower prices by ordering additional inventory, there is no
guarantee that the inventory will sell. Increasing prices may increase the profit margin, but it doesn't
result in higher sales. In fact, if the prices are too high, customers may not purchase the product, and
sales may decrease.

activities and amounts due for a specific time frame. Because the customer sent a partial payment for a
purchase, the balance due should be added to the next statement. To calculate the balance due, first
subtract the amount paid from the original purchase amount ($2,456.29 - $1,725 = $731.29). Then, add
this figure to the total of the most recent purchases ($731.29 + $466.23 = $1,197.52). The customer

Award purchasing contracts. Businesses maintain records about their vendors and use the information in

make an informed decision about the best vendor. This type of information does not help a business to
negotiate higher discounts, monitor inventory levels, or follow safe shipping procedures.

Prioritizing. Prioritizing involves ranking things in the order of their relative importance. When employees
prioritize their work, they evaluate several factors, including due dates and the time it will take to
complete a task. In Luke's situation, he determined that he needed to start acquiring bids before working
on the inventory report, even though the report was due before the bids. Because Luke realized that he
had to allow vendors time to provide the bids, he needed to give them the order specifications promptly.
Delegating is assigning authority or responsibility to others. Luke is not delegating, simplifying, or

Cut costs. In some cases, the amount of money you think you will need will not be possible to obtain.
When this happens, the most realistic approach is to look for ways to cut costs. If your ideal budget is
based on getting everything you want or would like to have, consider substituting inexpensive materials
for costly ones, or making do without some supplies. By cutting costs, you will be able to proceed with the
project. It is not necessary to lower your expectations because, in most cases, you will be able to
complete the project by making some substitutions. Decreasing the amount of time that is allotted for the
project will not necessarily make up for a lack of funding. Eliminating the project is not a good choice,

Lead time. Lead time is the amount of time it takes a vendor to process and deliver an order. Lead time is
affected by many factors including the distance from the shipper to the recipient, the type of
transportation the vendor uses, and the type of product. For example, a custom-made product usually
requires more lead time because part or all of the product is not produced until the order is placed. If a
product takes three months to produce, the buyer should make sure to order the product at least three
months before it is needed, and should make sure to add delivery time. Quantity discounts, unit pricing,
and billing issues are important factors that the buyer considers when placing an order, but they do not
directly relate to the delivery date.

Standing. Standing orders involve sending products at set intervals. This type of purchase order is ideal
for businesses that need the same amount of an item on a regular basis. In the example, SOA
Manufacturing may need the bolts to produce its products. Because SOA knows that it generates a set
amount of outputs in a certain amount of time, it advises its vendor (Colbert Company) to ship a certain
amount of bolts at intervals—every other week. An advance order is a regular order that is placed now
with delivery requested at a future time (e.g., weeks, months). A seasonal order is an order that is placed
for seasonal merchandise, such as snow shovels or beach umbrellas. An open order is an order for
staple goods that is placed with one of several available vendors who can meet the business's immediate
requirements (e.g., time, price, quantity).

Assess vendors' strengths and weaknesses. By assessing a vendor's strengths and weaknesses before
entering a negotiation, a business can plan strategies to use that will strengthen its own position during
the negotiating process. Planning and developing effective strategies can help the business obtain
desired discounts, favorable service options, or cooperative advertising support. And, the business may
make fewer concessions during the negotiation because it analyzed the vendor's capabilities before
beginning negotiations. To obtain a favorable agreement, the business should strive for a win-win
attitude. Adopting a win-lose attitude and using overly aggressive tactics may backfire, and prevent both
parties from getting what they want from the negotiation.

levels of excellence in relation to a process, good, or service. By monitoring various data, the business
can detect problems, which can help the business identify ways or opportunities for improvement. After
the business identifies opportunities for improvement, it can set goals to improve quality. The
improvement goals may or may not include budget and resource issues.

Businesses that provide ethics-training programs can reduce the business's level of risk. By providing an
ethics-training program, the business can advise its employees about its expectations in relation to
workplace behavior. Because an employee's personal ethics may differ from the organization's ethics, it
is important for the employees to have a clear understanding of the business's expectations. When
employees don't have a clear understanding of the business's expectations, they put the business at risk.
Businesses cannot assume that employees know their expectations. Employees who do not follow the
business's ethics guidelines may cross a legal line without knowing they have done so. If employees
cross ethical lines and break the law, the business may experience fines and obtain unfavorable publicity.
Management sets the tone for ethical behavior, so it is important that managers set a good example for
employees by exhibiting a high standard of ethics. By behaving ethically, the business can protect its
reputation with customers, vendors, and the community.

Surveillance cameras. By placing surveillance cameras throughout the facility, the business can monitor

Captive insurer. When businesses cannot obtain commercial insurance to cover a risk, they may legally
form insurance companies as subsidiaries or sister companies to cover the losses associated with the
risk. These insurance companies are called captive insurers because they exist only to serve a specific
purpose—they are held "captive" by their parent companies. Lending institutions loan money to
individuals and businesses. Generic provider and organic entity are not types of insurance providers.
