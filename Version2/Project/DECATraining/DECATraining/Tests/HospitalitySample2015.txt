Voluntary. The debtor is the individual or business that owes money to another individual or business
(creditor). An individual or business that obtains a credit card from a financial institution or retailer is
entering into a voluntary debtor-creditor relationship, which means that both the debtor and the creditor
enter the relationship willingly and understand the risks and expectations regarding the extension and
use of credit. Unintentional, customary, and implied are not types of debtor-creditor relationships.

The owners' personal property cannot be taken to pay the business's debts. An LLC (limited liability
company) form of business ownership is growing in popularity because of some of the ways it benefits its
owners. One of these is that the owners' personal property cannot be taken by creditors to satisfy the
debts of the LLC. Other characteristics of the LLC include its limited life and taxation of the owners'
income rather than the LLC's income. LLCs may need to have at least one or two members but does not
necessarily set a minimum of three members.

Hotel restaurants and banquet facilities generally increase the prices of their products. When a
community's leaders create legislation to increase taxes for food and beverage products, the businesses
that supply the products pass the tax increase to the consumer by raising prices on the products. The
types of businesses that provide food and beverage products include hotel restaurants and banquet
facilities. A tax increase in a certain community does not necessarily lead to less discretionary income for
all consumers of the hospitality product. If the hospitality segment in the community is comprised of more
restaurants than lodging facilities, then most of the hospitality businesses in the community are affected
by the tax increase. Food and beverage tax increases do not necessarily affect the price of the lodging
product since some lodging facilities (e.g., economy) do not offer food and beverage products. Because
some lodging facilities do not offer food and beverage product, tax increases do not necessarily force
lodging facilities to increase room rates on a seasonal basis.

Promotion. Coordinating channel management with other marketing activities such as promotion is
important to businesses because they need to have the goods in stock when they are advertised.
Businesses that promote goods they do not have in stock or on display run the risk of irritating customers
who want to buy the items. Businesses usually make sure that seasonal items will be delivered in
sufficient quantities and in time to be on display when the first advertisement appears. Visual
merchandising is display of merchandise in a store or department but does not involve having the goods
in stock. Pricing involves determining and adjusting prices to maximize return and meet customers'
perceptions of value. Public relations is a function of business that aims to establish good relations
between the business and the public.

Employee handbook. Businesses often develop employee handbooks that provide information about
their general policies and procedures. For example, a business might outline overtime and vacation
policies, disciplinary and grievance procedures, pay schedules, dress codes, and behavioral expectations
in its employee handbook. Employee handbooks are usually given to new employees when they first start
their jobs. Productivity manuals, customer newsletters, and personnel records are not sources that

Critical feedback. When employees present their ideas to management or coworkers, they should be
prepared to defend those ideas and provide supporting information. They also should be willing to accept
critical feedback because others might not agree with the ideas or have different opinions. Being
prepared will help employees remain objective and be able to offer logical evidence to back up their
ideas. Critical feedback is often useful because it allows employees to view their ideas from a different
perspective. Defending ideas usually does not involve accepting additional responsibility or nonverbal
support. It is not acceptable to attack employees on a personal level because of their ideas.

Make sure group members understand the group's purpose. The first step in holding a group discussion
is typically making sure that everyone understands the group's purpose and reason for having the
discussion. If group members don't know the desired outcome of the discussion, the discussion itself is
much less likely to be productive. After making sure that everyone knows the group's purpose, it is
important for the group members to agree on some ground rules for the discussion. Then, it's wise to find
out what group members know about the subject. Anyone with knowledge of the subject should share
what s/he knows about it so that the entire group can begin from the same starting point. It is not possible
to build on another group member's comment until someone else in the group contributes to the
discussion. You must also wait until later in the discussion to summarize what the group has said during
the discussion itself.

Rehearsing helps the speaker improve the delivery of the message. Rehearsing the presentation
provides the speaker with an opportunity to make sure that s/he is speaking at the appropriate pitch. It is
also a chance to monitor nonverbal behavior such as distractive gestures or mannerisms (e.g., swaying).
Presentation rehearsal allows the speaker to time the presentation and decide what revisions are needed
before the final event. Presentation notes are developed before rehearsal. The accuracy of the message
content should be verified at the time the presentation is developed. Verbal feedback from the intended
audience is provided at the final event, not at the rehearsal.

Email. The most appropriate communication channel for routine workplace messages such as Odessa's
reminder to employees is email. Since her message is likely to be the same each week, she can write the

at the end of each week. Phoning each employee to remind him/her would be very time-consuming.
Every employee probably does not have her/his own fax machine. Sending a letter to each employee

Contraction. Businesses are affected by external factors, which include changes in the business cycle.
The business cycle refers to the periods of expansion and contraction in economic conditions. When the
economy is strong and growing (expansion), businesses tend to make profits, expand operations, and
hire more employees. When the economy is on a downswing (contraction), businesses often experience
lower sales and profits, which has an unfavorable effect on the business. If a business's sales and profits
continue to decrease over time, it may lay off workers to cut costs, so it can continue to operate. Maturity
is a stage in a product's life cycle. Remission is not a phase in the business life cycle.

Developing strategies. When people are developing strategies (strategizing), they are coming up with a
plan of action to accomplish something. Strategizing for a negotiation involves anticipating the other
person's negotiating styles and strategies, and then planning appropriate responses. This helps the
negotiator prepare for different situations, which often lets him/her identify the most-likely-to-succeed
approach for getting what s/he wants. Establishing ground rules with the other party can facilitate a fair
negotiating environment, but having ground rules may not result in a favorable outcome for one or both
parties. Aggressive behavior is conduct based on a willingness to ignore the rights of others and to take
advantage of them to achieve personal goals. Negotiators do not decide how to get what they want by

jurisdictions must meet certain criteria. A rebate is a return of part of the price a customer pays for a
product, usually from the product's manufacturer. A refund is a sum of money given back to individuals or
businesses. Refunds are issued when an excessive amount has been paid (e.g., tax refund) or when
items have been returned to a business. Wage garnishments are court-ordered initiatives that involve
taking income taken from an employee's salary and submitting it to another person or organization.
Examples of garnishments include child support and alimony.

Manage money. A budget is an estimate of what income and expenses will be for a specific time period.
By developing a budget, individuals can manage their money. The budget will enable them to estimate
income, perhaps for the next month, and also estimate the various expenses such as car payment,
clothing, entertainment, etc. Then, they will be able to compare income with expenses and plan how to
spend their money. Preparing a budget will make it possible to determine if they are barely able to pay
bills each month or if there are funds remaining to put in a savings account. If funds are tight, they can
analyze the various expenses and find ways to cut back in order to more effectively manage their money.
Developing a budget allows individuals to identify the bills that must be paid; however, a budget does not
pay bills. A budget does not include a list of assets. Budgeting often helps individuals to decrease debt
by managing money more effectively.

Identity, accessibility, and durability of the market. Before a marketing plan can be conceived and
ultimately executed, an organization must be able to name, or identify, the target market and must be
able to communicate information to the group with the ability to buy. A durable market refers to the life
span, or longevity, of the market segment. Some target markets are short term while others are long
term. For example, a vacation package targeted to college students for a beach community that is
building retirement homes has a short-term market. Once the retirement homes are complete, the appeal
to college students decreases. While age, gender, and income may be factors in identifying a target
market, they are not always the first to be considered. The appropriate advertising medium cannot be
determined until the identity, accessibility, and durability of the target market are first assessed.
Economic conditions of the destination are subject to change; this is not always the first factor to
consider.

Increased compliance laws and regulations. Now, more than ever, the government is cracking down on
corporate dishonesty. Companies must adhere to an increased number of compliance laws and
regulations, and an appropriate information management program is a big part of that. Other trends in
information management include increased competition, an increased number of electronic documents,
and a decreased number of workers in the office.

Cut, paste. Business employees use word-processing software programs to create text documents, such
as letters, memos, and reports. Most word-processing programs have options that allow the user to move
text from one part of the document to another. To move text, the user highlights the text, touches the
"cut" button, which removes the text from its current position. The user moves the curser to the new
location and touches the "paste" button, which places the text in the new location. This simple process
saves time for business employees because they do not need to delete and retype the information. The
"copy" button duplicates the text but does not remove it from its current location. A "find and replace"
function helps the user to electronically locate and change words within the document.

Share information. Collaborative computer software allows employees to access the same business
information. For example, sales staff, promotions staff and accounting staff may need access to a
comprehensive customer database for different reasons. A salesperson may need to retrieve a
customer's purchasing history from the database to obtain the necessary facts s/he needs to process an
order. The promotions staff may need to access the database to obtain the customers' addresses for a
direct-mail campaign. The accounting staff may access the customer database to check the customers'
billing information. An advantage to sharing the information is that efficiency increases because the
employees have access to current and relevant information that they need to do their jobs. The primary
purpose of collaborative software is not to archive old documents, interpret data, or maintain authority.

Web server. Web servers are computer programs that deliver website content. Some businesses install
and maintain their own web servers. Because installing and maintaining web servers can be expensive,
businesses often decide to pay a fee to a web host, which provides the server space to meet their needs.
A PDF (portable document format) is a widely used document file format that was developed by Adobe.
The format allows users to view content, but users cannot alter the content. The PDF reader is a software
program that allows computer users to view PDF files. Many web pages are saved as PDFs; however,
businesses often use other formats. A wireless router is a device that provides Internet access to laptop
or portable computers without being directly connected to cable service. An affiliate partner is a business
that agrees to promote and sell another business's products on the Web in exchange for a sales

Compare variables. A chain of hotels might analyze and interpret the marketing information contained in
databases in order to compare several variables that change from property to property. For example, one
hotel might be located in an affluent suburb while another one is located in an urban area. The chain
might analyze the information in its database concerning both communities in order to make appropriate
marketing decisions such as the type of services to offer in each location. Although the chain provides
the same type of goods and services to both communities, it needs to analyze data in order to know if the
consumers in each community have different wants and needs. Before analyzing databases to compare
variables, a chain of hotels might survey guests and tabulate the findings. A chain would not analyze
databases in order to organize products.

To obtain credit. Businesses keep records to verify information for others. For example, if a business
wishes to obtain a loan from a bank, it must provide the bank with financial records to prove that it is
creditworthy. The financial records provide information about the business's income and expenses and
verify that the business will be able to repay the loan. Businesses only need to deposit funds in order to
open an account with a bank. A business that is paying a mortgage already has received a loan.

Document from being forwarded. Some businesses use software programs that help maintain the
security of data they send over the Internet to clients. These programs prevent documents from being

original form. These software programs do not prevent a virus from being downloaded, an attachment
from being included, or a search engine from being used.

This indicates that the applicant has read the question but either doesn't have the information available or
doesn't know the answer. It is always better to write in "unknown" or "NA" than to leave a blank space
that might make an employer think that an applicant forgot to answer the question. Applicants should
never make up answers. Employment applications are not allowed to contain the types of questions that

might feel that they can't reject bad ideas. Competitors won't recommend new products because they
don't want to lose business to others. Although trade associations might suggest ideas for new products,
the fact that they're recommending the products to local restaurants would fail to give any one restaurant

content in the website's URL may improve the website's rank or placement in the search results. Anchor

Promotion. Sponsoring this community event creates a positive public image for the hotel. An
endorsement involves obtaining approval from an external source. The marketing mix is the combination
of the four elements of marketingproduct, place, promotion, and price. The product mix is the
assortment of goods and services that a business offers to meet its customers' needs and its
organizational goals.

Sales promotion. This refers to any promotional activity other than advertising, publicity, and personal
selling. Examples of sales promotions include displays, coupons, and sweepstakes. Advertising is the
nonpersonal, paid presentation of ideas, images, goods, or services. Public relations is the process of
building goodwill toward an organization. Selling refers to the planned, personalized communication
made by a sales representative to influence a customer's purchase decision and enhance future
business opportunities.

Greet and be available for service/information. Customers who are browsing are often undecided and
want to look around before making a buying decision. These undecided customers often need prompting
or educating and really should not be left to browse indefinitely because they may leave. Always greet
your customers; do not make the customer initiate the contact. The decided customer wants a quick
transaction and should be given prompt service.

Benefits. Because services are intangible products that customers cannot see or touch, they are often
more difficult to sell than goods. Salespeople should be able to clearly explain the benefits, or
advantages, of those services to customers in order to close a sale. Customers are more likely to buy
services if salespeople adequately describe the benefits that they offer. Assets are anything of value that
the business owns. Goals are objectives. Traits are personal characteristics.

Upselling. When car rental agents suggest that customers rent more expensive vehicles than the ones
they signed up for online, the agents are using a sales technique known as upselling. This helps to
increase the amount of the sale. Substitute selling occurs when the requested item is not in stock or does
not meet the customer's needs. Suggestion selling involves recommending an additional item to
accompany the original purchase. Outsourcing involves the use of a third party to handle tasks that the
company used to handle internally.

$10.99. Restaurants often feature two-for-one dinner specials to attract customers. The offer is
contingent on at least two people dining together. The offer is valid for three people but only one dinner
will be free. Sometimes, the offer applies to larger groups of equal number such as a party of four or six
in which case two or three of the dinners will be free. In this situation, a party of three is taking advantage
of the two-for-one special, so the server should deduct the lowest priced dinner ($10.99) from the bill.
Two-for-one dinner specials usually do not include beverages so the server would not deduct the price of
a beverage from the bill. Also, desserts are often additional unless otherwise noted. Therefore, the server
should deduct only the price of the dinner.
