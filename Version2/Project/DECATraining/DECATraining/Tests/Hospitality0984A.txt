Recycling programs. Environmental regulations set pollution standards that hospitality businesses must
meet, establish rules for disposing of waste, encourage recycling, and monitor illegal dumping. The goal
is to protect the environment. By encouraging hospitality businesses to participate in recycling programs,
environmental regulations help to conserve natural resources and control waste. Agencies that oversee
environmental regulations are the ones that enforce the laws. Environmental regulations do not
encourage hospitality businesses to participate in resource identification or ethical contracts.

Limited partnership. A limited partnership permits a partner to invest in a business (e.g., bed and

combine capital, experience, and the abilities of two or more people. An open corporation sells millions of
shares of stock to many stockholders. Consolidation would be the joining of two or more companies to

Hotel restaurants and banquet facilities generally increase the prices of their products. When a
community's leaders create legislation to increase taxes for food and beverage products, the businesses
that supply the products pass the tax increase to the consumer by raising prices on the products. The
types of businesses that provide food and beverage products include hotel restaurants and banquet
facilities. A tax increase in a certain community does not necessarily lead to less discretionary income for
all consumers of the hospitality product. If the hospitality segment in the community is comprised of more
restaurants than lodging facilities, then most of the hospitality businesses in the community are affected
by the tax increase. Food and beverage tax increases do not necessarily affect the price of the lodging
product since some lodging facilities (e.g., economy) do not offer food and beverage products. Because
some lodging facilities do not offer food and beverage product, tax increases do not necessarily force
lodging facilities to increase room rates on a seasonal basis.

Capital. Resort gift shops cannot afford to invest in too much stock or too little. If too much stock is on
hand, storage costs add to the cost of the goods, and goods that are held too long may become outdated
or stale. If too little stock is on hand, customers' needs cannot be met. Sales volume is the amount of a
business's sales—usually expressed in dollars. A resort gift shop needs to maintain adequate stock to
satisfy its volume of sales. Accounts receivable are the monies owed to a business by its customers.
Distribution provides products with time and place utility.

Satellite tracking. Satellite tracking technology is based on the use of orbiting satellites, and enables
businesses to monitor the location of delivery trucks. Once a shipment is placed on a truck, the shipment
can be tracked by satellite so businesses know where the shipment is at all times. This technology
makes it possible for businesses to tell customers exactly where the shipment is and when it will be
delivered. Artificial intelligence is technology that is used to make computers perform functions that
people perform. Data interchange involves the exchange of information between one business's
computer system and another business's computer system. Electronic imaging makes it possible for
businesses to scan or take electronic photographs of documents.

Reverse. Reverse distribution involves customers returning used products to the manufacturer. This
process allows businesses to retrieve products, such as automobiles, refrigerators, and glass bottles, in
order to reuse them, recycle them, or properly dispose of them. Reverse distribution is considered ethical
because it helps to save natural resources and protect the environment. Taking back used products and
recycling or disposing of them is not an example of internal, joint, or closed distribution.

A manufacturer sells the same hospitality product to many competing businesses. Horizontal conflict
occurs between businesses at the same level in the distribution channel. Competing businesses that sell
the same hospitality product are on the same level. Conflict may occur between the competing
businesses if a manufacturer sells the same product to all of them, and they are all trying to sell the
product to customers. For example, hosiery is sold by drugstores, department stores, discount stores,
mail-order businesses, etc. Some of these businesses might complain to the manufacturer that the others
are using unfair sales tactics or offering more discounts. If this happens, these businesses are involved in
horizontal conflict. An intermediary selling directly to consumers, or a manufacturer beginning to sell
products online, might result in vertical conflict. An intermediary returning defective products for credit
does not cause horizontal conflict.

Downward, upward, and lateral. Communication in a hotel chain with a formal staff communication
system usually moves in three directions—up, down, and sideways. Upward communication is from
employees to management, downward communication is from management to employees, and lateral is
communication between staff members on the same level. Grapevine communication is unofficial
information passed from one person to another in writing or through conversation. An informal
communication system usually has an active grapevine. The other alternatives are not types of
communication.

very little instruction, while a group of new hotel employees might need very explicit directions on how to
complete a job. This is true no matter what organization, profession, or industry is involved.

Record all the information accurately. The front desk clerk who takes requests for wake-up calls should
make sure that s/he obtains the guest's name, room number, day or date, and the exact time that the
guest would like to receive a call. Recording this information accurately helps to ensure that the call will
be made correctly. A friendly attitude is important, but it is not necessary to have a friendly chat or inquire
about problems/complaints. Housekeeping does not need to know what time a guest has asked to be

Trough. A trough is the final phase of a business cycle and occurs when economic activities stop their
decline. This is the low point of economic activity because many more businesses fail, and
unemployment is very high. The economy remains in a trough until consumers and producers once again
become more hopeful about business and buy more goods and services. The high point of economic
activity occurs during the peak phase of the business cycle. A recession may occur during the contraction
phase of the business cycle. Valley is not a phase of the business cycle.

due to unclear boundaries. When people don't know what they're supposed to do, or what someone else
expects them to do, the conflict is due to unclear expectations. Exclusion is a reason for a conflict that

To match groups to table size. Hotel restaurants have only so many tables of each size, such as 10
tables for 2, 20 tables for 4, 15 tables for 6, etc. Therefore, when guests are on a waiting list, hotel
restaurants match the group with the appropriate table size that is available. For example, if a party of
four is next on the waiting list and a table for four becomes available, that party will be seated next.
However, in some cases a table for six will become available first. Then, the hotel restaurant will seat the
next group of six on the waiting list. This might mean that the party of four will wait longer even though
that group was first on the waiting list. Although guests are sometimes dissatisfied with this arrangement,
it is not cost effective for a hotel restaurant to put a party of four at a table for six unless there are no
other guests waiting. Hotel restaurants do not seat some groups ahead of other groups who arrived first
to accommodate special requests, to fill up unpopular space, or to give equal work to servers.

secured loan requires the borrower to provide collateral, or security, to the lender. Collateral might be in
the form of the hospitality business's accounts receivable which the lender can collect if the hospitality

Trouble spots. The information in an income statement is cumulative, which means that it covers a
specific period of time, usually one year. A business (e.g., resort and conference center) needs to be able
to see cumulative totals of income and expenses to know where it is having successes and where there
might be trouble brewing. If a business detects that it is spending too much on expenses compared to the
amount of net profit, it knows that the category of operating expenses is a trouble area that must be
corrected. Businesses do not use income statements to identify potential sales or problem vendors. Most
businesses probably do not think that income can ever be excessive.

Credit card. Most hotels ask guests to establish credit during the check-in process by having a credit card
imprinted. This method enables a hotel to keep track of a guest's charges and then settle the account
when the guest departs. Even if a guest wants to pay in cash, hotels usually ask for a credit card imprint
to cover any additional charges in the event that the guest leaves without paying for them. Some guests
pay with cash in advance or with traveler's checks and allow the hotel to imprint a credit card. Regular or
business guests sometimes establish an account with a hotel and are billed for room expenses.

Verify the accuracy of the front office daily accounting practices. An audit is an investigation or

guest and non-guest accounts is correct. By conducting the audit each night, the lodging facilities can
isolate and solve any problems quickly. The primary purpose of a night audit does not include the
development of a SWOT analysis. A night audit might track a guest's credit limit rather than the guest's
credit rating. Since it cannot be assumed that all lodging facilities are corporations, the night audit reports
are not used to create profit-and-loss statements for stockholders.

A shop keeps a copy of a credit-card receipt for a customer's purchase. Financial records are documents

monies owed to a gift shop by its customers. When a shop keeps a copy of a customer's merchandise
receipt, it is keeping a record of a financial transaction that involves the monies coming into the shop.
Providing customers with change and requesting cashier's checks are not examples of accounts

Checklist. A checklist is a listing of information. Human resources departments in hotels often construct
checklists that contain information about a job's responsibilities and tasks. The list also includes data
about special skills, training, or knowledge that are needed to perform the job. This checklist helps
human resources personnel to check the applicants' resumes to make sure that they meet the criteria
that are required to perform the job. An application form is a document that the job applicant completes
and contains information about the applicant's education, skills, training, and employment history. A
memorandum is a short report. An employment report is too general in nature to determine its purpose.

12. Depending on the type of hotel restaurant, servers can effectively serve only a certain number of
customers at one time. For example, servers at upscale hotel restaurants usually need to spend more
time serving individual customers than servers at a hotel sandwich shop. In this example, servers can
effectively serve 20 customers at one time. To determine the number of servers needed, the restaurant
first calculates the total number of potential customers by multiplying the number of tables by the size of
the tables (60 x 4 = 240). Then, divide that number by the number of customers one server can serve
(240 ÷ 20 = 12). The restaurant needs to schedule 12 servers to effectively serve all customers.

restrict access to specific employees who compile the information or to managers who use the
information. Other chains gather information that is not confidential or secret and is accessible to all
employees. Where the system is located, the hours the system will operate, and the type of system used
by competitors are not important factors that a chain considers when developing a marketing-information

Why customers no longer buy. Hotel supply businesses usually require salespeople to complete a variety
of sales reports, including lost-business reports. Businesses monitor lost-business reports because they
usually contain an explanation of why customers no longer buy from the business. The reports might
indicate that customers are dissatisfied with the product, dissatisfied with the business's credit policies, or
are getting better prices and more service from competitors. A business might use this information to
make changes to its marketing strategy in an attempt to regain customers or to prevent other customers
from taking their business elsewhere. The more information a business obtains from lost-business
reports, the better able it is to make useful and effective marketing decisions. Lost-business reports do
not include information about the design of competitors' products, reasons for local unemployment, or
quality of promotional materials.

descriptive statistics, which help the researchers summarize the information for analysis. The descriptive
statistics should provide the researchers with objective information rather than subjective data. Synectics

Market analysis. Bed and breakfasts need to gather and analyze marketing information in order to make
decisions about what to do in the future. A main concern for most bed and breakfasts is forecasting
sales. They want to be prepared to sell the right products in the right amount to the right market over a
period of years. To do that, they must understand changes in the market and in economic conditions. By
analyzing current market information, bed and breakfasts often are able to make fairly accurate sales
forecasts that allow them to plan for the future. A performance evaluation is a formal assessment by the
supervisor of a worker's job performance that lets the worker know how s/he is doing on the job. A case

Rate of productivity. A hotel supply business conducts a SWOT analysis to identify its internal strengths

in the same industry, productivity may be a strength or a weakness. A high rate of productivity is a
strength, while a mediocre or low rate of productivity is a weakness. It is important for a business to
consider its rate of productivity because high productivity may help the business to take advantage of
external opportunities. If the business finds that its productivity is low, it can take steps to correct the
problem. The type of industry, the location of the target market, and the amount of competition are
external factors that a business might consider when conducting a SWOT analysis.

Cost of performing marketing activities. Bed and breakfasts need to develop budgets to set aside the
funds that will be needed to perform marketing activities. Before they can develop budgets, they need to
determine the cost of performing those marketing activities. For example, bed and breakfasts need to
consider wages paid to employees and the cost of buying supplies. Once a bed and breakfast calculates
all the costs involved, it can develop a budget to fund the marketing activity. It is not effective to develop
marketing activities without setting a budget to pay for the activities. Bed and breakfasts do not consider

Scheduling. Scheduling involves setting a timetable for implementing the various activities that need to
be completed in order to achieve the objectives of a marketing plan. Once the activities are identified, a
hospitality business needs to decide who will perform each activity, how long each activity will take to
complete, and in what order each activity should be performed. Scheduling helps a business to control
the implementation of marketing activities in order to make sure they are completed effectively and on
time. Positioning is a product-mix strategy in which a business creates a certain image or impression of a
product in the minds of consumers. Forecasting involves predicting what will happen in the future.
Training is teaching or developing a specific skill.

55. B
Unrealistic objectives. Objectives are the goals that a hotel supply business seeks to reach with its
marketing plan. During the process of evaluating the plan, a business might find that its objectives are not
being met. One reason for this might be that the objectives are unrealistic and not possible for the
business to achieve at that time. For example, an objective of increasing sales by 50% in six months may
be completely unrealistic based on the product the business sells and the number of salespeople. If a
business determines that its objectives are unrealistic after evaluating the performance of its marketing
plan, the business should modify the objectives to make them more attainable. The use of targeted
activities and specific strategies often helps a business to achieve its marketing objectives. Intangibles
are not capable of being detected through the senses, whereas resources are items that can be used to
produce goods and services.

Wireless Internet. To attract business travelers, a lodging facility might consider offering wireless Internet.
Because business travelers often depend on their computers to retrieve business-related information
(e.g., e-mail), wireless Internet is a good service to offer because it allows business travelers to retrieve
this information from their hotel rooms. Cable television, DVD rental, and automated lighting are not
options that would help a business traveler to conduct business activities.

Walk-in. Walk-in guests are people who request rooms without making reservations in advance. By
tracking these guests, hotel managers can better forecast room sales. Tracking the walk-in guests can be
done manually by maintaining a tally or reservation sheet, or by coding the guest's folio in the computer
system. Split-folios refer to guests' bills that are charged to more than one account. Nonaffiliate and
property-management are not common terms used to describe ways to track guests without reservations.

Determine severity of the injury. The first thing a hotel employee should do if an accident occurs and a
guest is injured is to determine the severity of the injury and decide quickly whether the injury is life
threatening. If the injury appears to be life threatening, the hotel employee should then call the
emergency squad. If the injury does not appear to be life threatening, the hotel employee should notify
the department manager who will then handle the situation. Once the guest has been cared for, the hotel
employee should complete an accident report form.

Change. Change is something that occurs constantly and usually without warning. When developing a
project plan, a hotel should always provide for change because it is inevitable that something will change.

make the project successful. Not all projects require research or secrecy. Hotels don't provide for
publicity unless the project is unique and of interest to the public.

resources and capital goods used to produce goods and services. Supplies are economic resources.
Assets are anything of value the business owns. However, combining raw materials usually does not
create joint assets.

To lead the effort. Management sets the tone for quality in a business and leads the effort. If managers
do their best to achieve quality and set an example for employees, the employees usually follow.
Managers lead by setting clear goals, by making sure employees understand the goals, by giving
employees the information and tools they need, and by being supportive. They also lead by behaving the
way they expect employees to behave. The role of management in the achievement of quality in a
business is not to assign blame or judge the staff. Management should direct and guide. It is not possible
to eliminate conflict, although management often can control conflict.

Avoid direct skin contact and wear disposable gloves. To protect from bacteria transmission and skin
irritation, hotel housekeeping attendants should wear disposable gloves when using cleaning chemicals.
Housekeeping attendants generally alert their manager when cleaning-chemical inventory is low and do
not complete the purchase order. When mixing or using toxic or strong cleaning chemicals, eye goggles
or ventilation masks may need to be used. It is not necessary for attendants to keep a log of ingredients
found in the cleaning materials; the ingredients are listed on the cleanser storage containers.

work area clutter-free and keeping the supplies you need at hand are two of the most important work
habits and let others know you are focused and organized. Not having to "dig" to find something or leave
your work area to find supplies keeps you focused on the job at hand and keeps your productivity high.
Closing a point-of-sale register involves settling the transactions for the day and putting cash in the bank

suspicious-looking persons, will help avoid burglaries and can help discourage dishonest guests as well.

Contact all guest rooms. To increase the safety of their guests, many hotels have installed automated
systems to assist with fire control and fire emergencies. One feature of most automated systems is that
they are able to contact all guest rooms and notify the occupants of the fire emergency. These systems
usually provide specific instructions as to how to safely exit the hotel. Another feature of most systems is
that they automatically close the fire doors in an attempt to control the spread of fire. These systems do
not identify hazardous materials or prevent bomb threats.

Quality. Customers often associate price with quality. For example, customers assume if the price of a
hotel room is high, that the the quality is high. Full-service hotels that provide upscale services and
amenities usually charge high rates for their rooms because guests expect to pay high prices for the
quality services. High prices are realistic to guests who stay in full-service hotels. If the hotels lowered
their prices, guests might not stay there because the rates are lower than expected, and they might
assume that the quality is also low. Guests of full-service hotels do not associate high prices with value or
economy. Supply is the quantity of a good or service that sellers are able and willing to offer for sale at a
specified price in a given time period.

Confuses customers. A hospitality business that deliberately tries to confuse customers about the price of

them difficult for customers to understand. As a result, customers usually are unable to figure out how to
get a lower price and end up spending more than they should. This practice is considered unethical
because customers don't have a fair chance to get the best price. Most pricing tactics are intended to be
competitive. It is also common for businesses to advertise discounts and offer rebates. These tactics are
not unethical.

through creative-thinking techniques. Businesspeople often use creative-thinking techniques to solve
problems.

Evaluate it against general criteria. Before a hospitality business invests time, personnel, and money to
take an idea and turn it into a product, it must determine if the product is feasible or reasonable to make
and market successfully. By establishing criteria (judgment statements or standards), the business can
weigh the pros and cons of the idea before going forward with product development. A business
develops a product prototype after determining that the idea is feasible. A survey is a marketing-research
tool that a business uses to obtain information about a good or service. Simply developing a customer
survey does not establish the feasibility of the product idea. Additionally, writing a marketing proposal
does not help the business determine the product idea's feasibility.

Ask its guests for positive and negative feedback. It is important for a hotel to know if it is meeting its
customers' needs, wants, and expectations. If guests are unhappy with a hotel, it will likely lose business
to its competitors. Therefore, the hotel needs to determine what it is doing right and what it is doing
wrong by obtaining both positive and negative feedback. Because many employees are in direct contact
with hotel guests, they are often good sources of information. However, requiring employees to complete
guest surveys will not provide the hotel with the most reliable information. Merely planning a focus group
will not provide the hotel with feedback—the company must hold the focus group. A complaint rating
scale is one tool that the hotel might use to evaluate positive and negative feedback.

a package that includes accommodations, meals, and a sightseeing trip is an example of product
bundling. In the hospitality industry, it is common for hotels to develop weekend packages to encourage
guests to stay at the properties during times when the hotels are not filled. Offering a weekend package
is not an example of price positioning, individual selling, or target advertising although hotels might target
the package to a specific audience.

Is a convenience to guests. Hotels with restaurants provide guests the opportunity to relax and dine—
both of which are important to weary travelers. Hotel dining facilities are conveniences for guests
because they do not need to leave the premises to eat their meals. Guests who appreciate these types of
services are more likely to return to the hotel, which gives it a competitive edge over other nearby hotels.
In addition, groups that are planning meetings or conventions usually choose a facility that provides
complete service. This can increase a hotel's revenues substantially, thereby increasing its competitive
edge. Not all hotels offer room service, or the delivery of meals to the guests' rooms. Hotels with dining
facilities do not necessarily reduce the number of dissatisfied guests if other services (e.g., clean rooms)
do not meet their expectations. Dining facilities do not necessarily increase the employees' productivity.

Each touch point is an opportunity to reinforce the brand with guests. Every day, hospitality businesses
(e.g., motels) have hundreds, even thousands, of opportunities to touch customers with their brand
values and to build brand equity. These touch points include virtually every way in which the motel has
contact with a guest—be it an invoice, a promotional message, or the way something is positioned on the
shelf. Customers (guests) do not select brands based on which have the most touch points; in fact, they
have no way of knowing this. They select brands that consistently meet and exceed their expectations.
Motels do not get tax breaks based on touch points. Well-developed touch points are a major factor in
building a hospitality business's success; however, touch points alone are no guarantee. There are a
whole host of other factors that influence a motel's success, including its management, its location, its
competition, and the economic environment in which it operates.

strengths, and as representations of the brand, a hotel's name and slogan may imply its strengths or
competitive edge. Although some hotels allude to their strengths and competitive advantages on the
Internet, they would not use their FAQs to address these issues.

females now share the responsibility of household chores. Discrimination is the unfair treatment of a
person or group based on the person's or group's characteristics. Some people consider an

Build close and ongoing guest relationships. Technological advancements, such as the Internet and

service options, the resort is more likely to build close and ongoing relationships with guests. Depending
on the medium, mass advertising is often more expensive than advertising to targeted markets. Many

Point-of-sale terminal. A point-of-sale terminal is capable of more than automatically transmitting data
about each transaction directly to a computer. It can also be used to prepare gift certificates when a
cashier keys in information related to the sale. A modem is computer hardware that transmits electronic
information. A ledger is the accounting record for a specific department or area of a business. A scanner
is a wand or electronic screen that "reads" UPC codes found on products.

Guaranteed. By giving the credit card number, the guest agrees to pay for the room even if s/he is not
able to use it. A confirmed reservation is one made in enough time to allow the hotel to acknowledge the
request in writing or by giving a confirmation number over the phone. A modified reservation is one that is
changed after it has been made. Anonymous is not a type of reservation.

Staffing. Staffing is the management function of finding workers for the sales department. Organizing is
the management function of setting up the way the sales department's work will be done. Leading
activities encompass the manager's ability to guide or direct sales personnel in a desired manner.
Planning is the management function of deciding what will be done and how it will be accomplished.

The department is generating enough business in relation to the financial investment. The financial
investment is the money that a company pays (e.g., payroll, menus, food, and supplies) to maintain the
department. If the department is doing high volumes of events and if the events are profitable, then the
financial investment should be lower than the sales generated, which is good for the food and beverage
department. Physical inventories are done on a regular basis in most food service facilities. Therefore,
the hotel manager does not generally determine if a physical inventory should be conducted based on
findings in the sales income report. Each department has controllable expenses that need to be recorded
in some manner. For example, payroll is a controllable expense. Payroll must be recorded (usually in the
human resources or payroll department) for tax purposes. The banquet services department is not
generally responsible for the promotional activities of other hotel services.

Traveler's. Traveler's checks are frequently used by people who are traveling. They have been paid for in
advance, and contain the purchaser's signature as well as a line for the purchaser to countersign when
cashing them. To make sure that the person cashing the check is the legitimate owner, ask the hotel
guest to countersign the check in your presence. Watch as the guest countersigns each check and
compare that signature to the original. Bank checks, certified checks, and cashier's checks are issued by
a financial institution and are already made out to a particular business or person. They do not need to be
countersigned.

Their decisions affect the entire chain. Top-level management is composed of all managers who are
responsible for the entire hotel chain. They receive higher salaries than other managers because they
make important decisions that affect the whole chain. They may or may not have more experience than
others in the chain or be required to attend a great many meetings. Top-level management is not
involved in hands-on supervision.
