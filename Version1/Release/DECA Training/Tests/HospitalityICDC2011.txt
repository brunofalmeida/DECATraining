Consistent treatment. Legal procedure refers to the methods and processes used to protect an
individual's or business's legal rights. These rights include the right to obtain legal counsel, the right to be
heard in court, the right to confront the accuser, etc. Legal procedure involves following the same steps
and protocol to ensure that both the defendant and the plaintiff are treated in a fair and consistent
manner. The purpose of legal procedure is not to ensure that each party receives ongoing advice. In
most legal proceedings, one party is not going to be satisfied with the verdict or outcome. An indictment
is a formal charge or accusation of a crime.

Reasonable care. When hospitality and tourism businesses act in a way that a reasonable hospitality and
tourism business would have acted, the business exhibits reasonable care. If hospitality and tourism
businesses can prove that they acted with reasonable care, they are not fined by the courts. Otherwise,
the courts can find them guilty of negligence, and they would be charged a fine. It's not possible for
hospitality and tourism businesses to avoid all risks. There is always the chance that something bad can
happen. Hospitality and tourism businesses are not insurers of their customers nor do they take out
insurance on each customer. Instead, they take out liability insurance that transfers risk to an insurance
company. Hospitality and tourism businesses act so that they limit their responsibility for accidents.

Exclusive agreements. Exclusive agreements are a supplier's requirements for its customer to handle
only its products or to agree to not handle other companies' products. When this restricts trade, it is
considered illegal in Canada and in the U.S. A partnership agreement is a written agreement signed by
business partners that specifies the terms of the partnership arrangement. Contracts are legal
agreements between two or more businesses stating that one party is to do something in return for
something provided by the other party. Once contracts are signed and accepted by the businesses, they
are considered binding agreements in that if one of the parties fails to live up to the agreement, the party
will be guilty of breach of contract. Joint ventures are arrangements that involve two or more businesses
entering into a relationship by combining complementary resources such as technology, skills, capital, or
distribution channels, for the benefit of all parties; the relationship is usually short-term or for a single
project/transaction. Joint ventures, binding contracts, and partnership agreements do not inhibit trade.

Channel management and promotion. The restaurant is using a new channel, its website, to offer its
baked goods to customers. To attract traffic to the website, the marketing communications director used
publicity when appearing on the talk show and sales promotion by offering incentives. The website had to
function properly to accommodate the sales volume generated by the incentives. Marketing-information
management deals with gathering, accessing, synthesizing, evaluating, and disseminating information for
use in making business decisions. Product/service management involves obtaining, developing,
maintaining, and improving a product or service mix in response to market opportunities. In this scenario,
the product mix has not been changed.

The use of company property. Businesses often develop employee handbooks, which provide
information about their general policies and procedures. Employee handbooks are usually given to new
employees when they are hired. Employee handbooks usually provide information about overtime and
vacation policies, disciplinary and grievance procedures, pay schedules, dress codes, and behavioral
expectations in its employee handbook. Many employee handbooks include information about employees
and their personal use of company property. Company-property issues that the handbook might address
include making personal long-distance phone calls on the company phone and using the office copy
machine or laser printer for non-business purposes. Lists of the company's current job openings and
personal information about vacation days are usually available through the human-resources department,
and are not included in the employee handbook. Additionally, the company's annual report is not usually
included in the employee handbook. Often, corporations post their annual reports on the company's web
site.

Distracted. Nonverbal cues are the elements of communication that involve gestures and facial
expressions rather than words. Nonverbal cues often express what the senders and recipients think
about their messages. If Colin was interested in the meeting topic or was listening to the speaker, he
would be directing his attention to the speaker. Since Colin was looking at his phone and text messaging,
he was distracted and was probably not paying attention to what the speaker was saying. The speaker
likely felt that Colin's nonverbal behavior was rude and inconsiderate. There is not enough information to
determine if Colin was annoyed.

Organize content in a cohesive, manageable way. Long business reports often contain a lot of
information about different topics. To organize the information so the audience can understand the
report's contents, report writers often break content into chunks of related information. Headings and
subheadings are often included before the section or topic to let the audience know the issue at hand.
Headings and subheadings do attract attention because they are often formatted with a larger or colorcoded
font; however, the primary purpose is not to convey a hidden agenda, provide supporting
evidence, or solicit an opinion from the audience.

Contact information, product model number, and manufacturer. A letter of inquiry is a request for
information. The businessperson should provide the manufacturer of the equipment and the product's
model number so the letter recipient knows which item to provide a price for. The letter writer should also
include his/her contact information—-e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address—so the
message recipient knows who or where to send the requested information. The businessperson is asking
for a price but not placing an order. So, the business person would not provide a purchase order number.
The vendor generates an invoice after the order has been placed. If the vendor provides quantity
discounts, the businessperson may need to indicate the quantity desired to provide accurate prices.

Profitable for the business. Because the marketplace is extremely competitive, many businesses are
focusing their efforts on building good, long-term relationships with the customers who have the most
potential to buy. These customers are the ones who will generate sales and profits for the businesses.
This effort is often referred to as customer relationship management. By viewing the relationship as a
partnership, a business has a better chance of keeping the customer for the long-term and keeping them
loyal to the business and to its brands. Customers who are easily influenced or interested in change are
more likely to be motivated to try another business's products.

The substitution effect. A change in relative prices that causes buyers to replace the purchase of one
product with another is a phenomenon called the substitution effect. In the example, Joseph decided that
he did not want to pay the increased amount for premium gasoline and opted to buy regular gasoline
instead because it was less expensive. A price ceiling is a maximum legal price that businesses can
charge for certain products. The market-clearing (equilibrium) price is the point at which the quantity of a
product that buyers want to buy is equal to the quantity that sellers are willing to sell at a certain price. A
buyer's market is the best time for consumers to buy, which usually occurs when there is a large supply,
small demand, and low prices.

False. Many other stakeholders can be affected by unethical business behavior. Although employees and
customers are affected by unethical business practices, businesses must fulfill obligations to other
stakeholders including investors and the community at large. For example, investors lost billions dollars

unethical behavior by Enron leaders. In addition, companies engaging in the controversial practice of
offshoring, cost jobs and tax revenue for the local community.

Visitor exports. The money spent by foreign travelers in another country is known as visitor exports. The
earnings from these sources was expected to be to be more than 6% of total exports by 2010. That
translates to a dollar figure of $1,086,000,000, and that figure is expected to more than double by 2020.
When international travelers visit other countries, they also buy other goods and services while visiting.
This helps businesses in addition to those in hospitality and tourism. Although hospitality and tourism
businesses are encouraged to use sustainable resources, their use does not contribute to economic
growth. Provision of conference space is a first step in getting groups to visit an area, but they do not in
and of themselves create economic growth. Global positioning systems help to determine how to get to
and from locations. They do not impact economic growth.

Speculative. Speculative risk brings the possibility of gain, no change, or loss. When opening and running
a business, the owner may turn a profit (gain), break even (no change) or go bankrupt (loss). A pure risk
involves the possibility of loss or no loss. For example, if a tornado occurs, it may hit the building and
cause damage (loss) or pass the building and not cause damage (no loss). Because many factors affect
the risk involved in opening and operating a business, the risk is ongoing rather than temporary—until
Lauren closes or sells the business. Safety risks are preventable or controllable types of risks that involve
the physical well-being of employees, customers, and visitors.

High unemployment. Consumer spending is one factor that indicates the health of the economy.

Western cultures embrace the idea that working hard will reap personal rewards and fulfillment. Culture
refers to the customs, habits, and traditions of a particular group of people. Because culture and cultural
differences affect business relationships, it is important for businesspeople to understand and adapt to
cultural differences in business situations. In other words, exhibit cultural sensitivity. Individualism is the
degree to which a group of people value independent work and accomplishments. Western culture (e.g.,
Canada, United States, England) places a high value on individual accomplishments achieved through
hard work. On the other hand, collectivism is an emphasis on group work and accomplishments. Eastern
cultures (e.g., China, Japan) tend to value group decision making and accomplishments over individual
efforts. Time and gender roles are important considerations when exhibiting cultural sensitivity, but these
factors are not related to the concept of individualism.

Miscommunication. Conflicts are disagreements. Disagreements happen for different reasons.
Sometimes, it's a matter of miscommunication or misunderstanding. In the example, Tim thought he

Tim's manager thought he told Tim that he wanted the report earlier than he originally requested, but
really forgot to tell Tim. The disagreement did not occur because Tim had limited resources, because he
questioned his manager's authority, or because each party held inconsistent opinions.

Everyone who is involved in the process holds equal power. A consensus is a decision-making outcome
that requires the substantial agreement of each group member. Every member must agree to a decision
or outcome. The decision may not be each member's first choice, but each member agrees with all
options. In consensus building, every group member has an equal level of power, so there are no
leaders. Because each member has equal power, it reduces behavior that promotes self-interest over the
best interest of the entire group. Voting is a decision-making method in which votes are counted for or
against an alternative, and whichever alternative has the greatest number of votes, wins. Drawbacks to
using consensus as a decision-making method is that it is often time-consuming and conflicts are likely to
occur because each member must discuss his/her opinions and points of difference.

No. In many situations, political coalitions can influence management to make positive changes. Political
relationships involve influencing others to take a certain course of action. Political relationships form at
different levels of a business for different reasons. Political coalitions tend to form when employees share
similar concerns or ideas about a single issue. The coalition may last for a limited time to accomplish a
specific goal. For example, several employees may have a common goal to improve a production
process so they can perform their jobs more efficiently. Once the improvements have been made, the
coalition would likely dissolve. Employees may engage in scapegoating and backstabbing practices to
advance their careers, but this is not normal behavior for most workers. Cliques are groups of people
who share similar interests and values. Cliques can form in any type of group or organization. While
some cliquish behavior may negatively impact a business, it does not always result in inefficiencies or
conflict. Conflict or disagreement is unavoidable in business—the way the conflict is handled influences
the outcome.

How are your fees structured? Because financial planners are compensated in different ways, it is
important to consider the fee structure when selecting a financial-services provider. Some financial
planners charge a flat fee, while others base their fees on the number and size of transactions. Some
financial planners charge for research and consulting time. Therefore, it is important to ask financial
planners about their fee structures, so investors can determine if they can afford the fees. A financial
planner may provide references for a potential client, but the potential client does not generally need to
provide the financial planner with references. It is inappropriate to ask the financial planner about his/her
personal income. Where the financial planner attended school is irrelevant.

Mutual funds. A mutual fund is a collection of shareholders' money that is invested by professional fund
managers in an assortment of different securities, such as stocks and bonds. Because the money is
spread out over different types of investments, it provides the investor with a diversified portfolio. If one
stock performs poorly, the investor still has many other types of investments in the fund that may be
performing well, which reduces the risk of severe financial losses. Corporations sell corporate bonds to
investors as a way to raise cash for their businesses. The corporation (borrower) pays back the full
amount plus interest to the investor within a certain time. A certificate of deposit is a type of lending
investment in which the investor lends the money to the bank at a set interest rate for a particular period
of time. The government issues Treasury bonds. The government pays back the full amount of the bond
plus interest to the investor over a certain time frame, which varies by the type of Treasury bond
purchased.

Learn where activities are located in the park to answer visitors' questions courteously. Businesses work
hard to develop and maintain a certain brand or image in the minds of their customers. Employees are
touch points that help the business reinforce that image by the ways in which they conduct their work.
Front-line employees (e.g., ticket takers, concession workers, ride operators) should greet the customers
pleasantly and be able to direct them to various park services. So employees understand what is
expected of them, management should communicate and train the employees and familiarize them with
the park. Front-line employees may hand out brochures, but they usually do not print them. The publicrelations
function carries out public-relations activities. Designated employees will arrive at the park
before it opens to perform pre-opening duties.

Add a Guest Satisfaction Survey on the its own website. Customers can use these surveys to voice both
their positive and negative experiences with the business. Positive experiences can be used on the
website to give testimonials to potential customers, while negative experiences can be addressed
directly. The business can re-direct dissatisfied customers to another website so that their concerns can
be addressed in further detail. In this way, dissatisfied customers have a forum for voicing their concerns.
The business can use this forum to improve its relationship with dissatisfied customers. TripAdvisor does
not allow businesses to limit negative feedback from customers. Customers can be asked to complete
feedback surveys but cannot be required to do so. Identifying complaints is not sufficient. Businesses
need to resolve customer dissatisfaction.

Age and life cycle. Baby boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. Baby boomers, therefore,
represent people of a particular age range that is aging. Many baby boomers are empty nesters, and they
have the money and time to travel. Art appeals to males and females; therefore, gender was not used as
a basis for segmentation. Although the tour group will experience different cultures, personalities, and
geographies, those were not used as the basis for market segmentation.

Developing tour products specifically designed to appeal to retirees. Demographics are the physical and
social characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education) of a population or market segment. Businesses
consider demographic trends because changes in the population have an effect on the existing and
potential products they market. Because trends indicate that a large segment of the population is aging
and reaching retirement, hospitality/tourism businesses are developing products to attract retirees who
are no longer in the workforce and have more time to travel. Tour products designed for retirees would
not likely appeal to recent college graduates, families with young children, or business travelers.

To provide a way for travelers to share their experiences. The Internet has provided a mechanism for
satisfied and unsatisfied customers to tell others about their experiences with a business. The comments
of other customers are viewed as more credible statements than advertisements from the business.
Therefore, travel and tourism businesses are providing this forum so that satisfied customers can spread
the good word, while the problems identified can be addressed and corrections made, if needed.
Hospitality and tourism businesses are not using social networking to connect travelers with similar
interests, to book travelers' upcoming trips, or to notify travelers of flight cancellations.

A purchasing agent awards a large order to a relative's employer. A conflict of interest occurs when
decision making is affected by personal gain or interest. If the purchasing agent's relative is a spouse
who may earn a bonus on the order, then the purchasing agent has a personal interest in the transaction.
Many businesses address conflicts of interest in their ethics policies. If the company's ethical policies are
followed, providing customer discounts, having lunch with clients, and using the company discount to
purchase goods are not examples of unethical behavior nor are they a conflict of interest.

The employer does not take steps to correct the issue. Businesses must follow certain health and safety
regulations to ensure a safe working environment for employees. When employers do not follow
regulations, it is important to take action to correct the situation. In many situations, the issue can be
resolved easily. For example, an employee might notice that boxes are blocking an exit and tell his/her
supervisor about the infraction. Then, the supervisor can take steps to ensure the boxes are moved to an
appropriate location. When the employer does not take steps to correct the issue, employees should
report the infraction to the appropriate government agency. There is not enough information provided to
determine if housekeeping personnel are violating the regulations that govern the way businesses must
dispose of hazardous-materials. The vendor is not the employee's employer.

Delivery timeliness. When selecting a supplier, businesses must consider delivery timeliness. The
business must ask if the supplier can deliver the goods when they are needed. In some situations, it may
be better for a business to use a supplier who may be a little more expensive, but in closer physical
proximity of the business, if that supplier can consistently meet delivery requirements. Personnel policies
are guidelines for employees' behavior in the workplace. The exchange rate is the value of one nation's

Improve quality and reduce inefficiencies. Six Sigma is a quality-management framework that involves
continuously setting higher goals of perfection. Six Sigma builds upon previous goals to set higher goals
in order to continuously improve the quality of the business's goods, services, or processes. The ultimate
goal is to maximize outputs, reduce inefficiencies and waste, have no process or product defects, and
minimize production costs. If these actions are successful, the business's profits may increase. As a
quality-control framework, the primary purpose of Six Sigma is not to eliminate resources, lessen
decision making, influence regulation, or decrease outputs.

Place recycling bins throughout the venue. Many universities and businesses are using large, green

chain with its target consumers. If they had completed this phase in the new-product development
process, the corporate office might have determined that the size of the target market was inadequate,
the timing of the concept was inappropriate, etc. In any of these cases, the hotel chain could have saved
time and money by deciding not to move forward with the idea. Another phase that the corporate office
failed to complete was business analysis: projection of sales, costs, and profit. If this phase had been
completed, the corporate office could have determined that sales would be insufficient, costs would be
too high, and/or profit inadequate to support the new venture. The company actually built a hotel property
to conduct its test market. It also commercialized its product idea by deciding when, where, how, and to
whom to market the hotel.

There was little difference in hues. As colors get closer to gray, closer in hue, and equal in shade, they
are less noticeable. Color contrast occurs when lighter, saturated colors are used. When saturated hues
are separated from each other, the colors are noticeable. It's when they're next to each other that they
become more difficult to discern.

They signal the type of Internet medium that best reaches the audience. Research shows that men and
youth are most likely to be reached with Internet games, while women are most likely to be reached with
Internet videos. Knowing this helps marketers match the Internet medium with its target audience. The
audience does not determine the type of product to give away or the theme of the viral marketing
campaign. Information on the Internet is run 24/7 rather than at specified times as with radio and
television advertising.

Discounts. Often, offering customers incentives for referrals encourages them to provide the name and
contact information of their friends and associates. The incentives offered are generally small so that the
salesperson doesn't “go broke” from providing them. Free product and trips would generally fall into the
category of being too costly for the salesperson. Job interviews are not tied to customer referral
programs.

Product placement. For the audience, the billboard is an example of product placement. Product
placement is the inclusion or mention of a product in a movie or television show. InterContinental would
have paid to have the billboard featured in the new movie. For the actors, the billboard is out-of-home
advertising. Personal selling involves determining client needs and wants and responding through
planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and enhances future business
opportunities. Special events are planned activities used to generate sales.

Introduce the call to action early in the material. When readers are skimming through direct marketing
materials, they often stop reading before getting to the end of the material. Therefore, writers shouldn't
wait until the end of the material to mention the call to action. Naturally, it should be repeated and could
be included in the P.S. of the material. Writers want to set their products off from those of the competitors
so that readers clearly understand what makes their products the best buy. Writers want to make the call
to action as simple as possible for readers rather than sending them to another location to obtain an
order form. Incredible claims can damage the company's image. Claims need to be credible.

Bulleted content to facilitate skimming and understanding. When people read Internet ad copy, they
generally skim content rather than reading ads in-depth or looking for detailed copy. The ad copy should
be emotional to gain the readers' interest. Rather than talking about “we,” the writer should direct the
copy to “you.”

An evening for fifth graders while their parents shop at the mall. This topic ties into the image of the park
being a safe place for kids. It will appeal to both fifth graders who ask to go to the theme park as well as
to their parents who pay for the theme-park visits. A midnight block party would be too late for children to
participate. An ESL workshop and wine-tasting do not relate to the park's image of a safe place for kids.

The activity closely relates to products it offers. Some of Best Buy's employees are computer savvy, so
teaching community members about using the new operating system would be a logical choice for a
community outreach activity. This helps Best Buy's employees develop relationships with community
members that go beyond “making the sale,” and will hopefully translate into sales in the long term.
Although Best Buy is a large national chain, it would not have exclusive distribution rights to the operating
system. Since the workshop was free, Best Buy was not making any profit on the workshops. There is no
way for us to determine whether the activity contributes to the company's mission.

that have recently occurred at the company. This might include new product releases, hiring of a key staff
member, philanthropic activities in which the business has engaged, etc. A permission to print form is not
needed since the goal of the press kit is to get information published. Providing coupons and a copy of
the CEO's latest speech could be included in the press kit; however, they are not as critical as the press
releases.

Sales promotion. Sales promotion consists of any activity other than advertising, publicity, and personal
selling that are designed to increase sales. The prizes that can result from use of Monopoly help to
increase sales. Transit advertising is a form of out-of-home media such as billboards, car wraps, and
street furniture ads. Personal selling is an effort by a company representative to complete sales
transactions. Publicity is any nonpersonal presentation of ideas, goods or services that is not paid for by
the company or individual which benefits from or is harmed by it.

Suggestion selling. When wait staff recommends food items, such as desserts, to go with the customer's
original purchase, they are using suggestion selling. By suggesting an additional item, the wait staff are
trying to increase the amount of their sales. Closing the sale occurs when the customer has made a
buying decision. Trading up occurs when the wait staff recommends a more expensive menu item than
that requested. Overcoming objections occurs when the wait staff turns a customer's reasons for not
buying into selling points with which the customer agrees.

Upselling. When car rental agents suggest that customers rent more expensive vehicles than the ones
they signed up for online, the agents are using a sales technique known as upselling. This helps to
increase the amount of the sale. Substitute selling occurs when the requested item is not in stock or does
not meet the customer's needs. Suggestion selling involves recommending an additional item to
accompany the original purchase. Outsourcing involves the use of a third party to handle tasks that the
company used to handle internally.

action for achieving pricing objectives. Using a scanner to process a sales transaction does not ensure
customer satisfaction. Businesses do not use image or laser scanners to develop service standards.
