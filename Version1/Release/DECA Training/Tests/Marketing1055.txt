Face-to-face meeting. When a supervisor must address a sensitive, personal, or confidential issue (e.g.,
salary) with an employee, it is best to discuss the issue in a private, face-to-face meeting. Company
newsletters, telephone conference calls, and staff memos are appropriate ways to communicate and
share pertinent information with several people at one time.

Provide a meeting agenda to review. An agenda is a list of topics that will be discussed in a meeting. By
having an agenda before the meeting takes place, employees can gather information and prepare notes
for the discussion. Unless the department's financial status is the reason for the meeting, participants are
unlikely to need a copy of the department budget. It is seldom appropriate to limit each participant's
speaking opportunities.

Create positive customer/client relations. Policies that establish appropriate attitudes toward

customers have for not buying, and they are handled with selling techniques that may involve disagreeing

Sales force automation technology. Many companies use sales force automation (SFA) technology to
support, coordinate, and increase the productivity of their sales professionals. SFA technology, which is
a type of customer relationship management software, can help to automate many aspects of the sales
process, such as tracking leads, prospects, and customers. Other SFA technology features include
contact management, sales forecasting, and sales report generation. Campaign management software is
used by marketers to develop, execute, and track the effectiveness of promotional campaigns to targeted
groups of potential or established customers. Businesses often use personalization technology to target
certain products to certain customers based on the customers' purchase history. Matching engine
technology works in a similar manner. Based on a particular customer's needs or preferences, matching
engine technology determines the product offering that would best appeal to that customer.

Automation. Automation is the use of robots or other automatic equipment to do certain tasks. A business
might make up for the shortage of qualified workers by relying more on the use of automated equipment
or machinery. For example, the use of automatic telephone systems often eliminates the need for a
business to hire experienced phone operators. Production is the process or activity of producing goods
and services. Specialization is the process of making the best use of resources in the production of

Misleading consumers. Ethics are the principles that guide a person's behavior. Ethics provide direction
for a person when s/he is determining which actions are right and which actions are wrong. Society,
which includes the business environment, provides us with general rules about ethical (right) or unethical
(wrong) behavior. For example, deliberately misleading consumers is unethical business behavior.
Misleading consumers involves not revealing the full truth about a good, service, or business activity. In
some cases, misleading consumers can cause physical harm, which is clearly unethical behavior by
societal standards. Identifying target markets, persuading others, and questioning standards are
reasonable, ethical business activities.

reduce the tax liability on the amount of income that a person earns.

Financial plan. The risk of financial loss is the basic risk in business. The key to reducing financial risk is
the estimate of financial needs, capital, to support alternative target returns for each aspect of the
business. Therefore, the development of a financial plan is a critical step in reducing business risk. The
marketing plan is a set of procedures or strategies for attracting the target customer to a business. The
information system provides an organized way of gathering, sorting, analyzing, evaluating, and
distributing the data the business needs. Cash-flow analysis predicts whether the cash generated by a
business can cover the operating expenses and loan repayments. This analysis identifies the need for
capital but does not create it.

Determine customer-satisfaction levels. Businesses obtain and use marketing information for many
reasons. Businesses often ask customers for feedback to determine how satisfied the customers are with
their goods and services. Some tools that businesses use to obtain this information are written surveys

is doing well and where it might need to make changes to improve customer-satisfaction levels. The
primary purpose of conducting the survey is not to obtain demographic data, predict the feasibility of a
product idea, or learn about trends in the marketplace.

because it usually indicates that the business is selling less and losing profits. In other situations, the
business wants to obtain information about competitors, new products, new market opportunities, or
economic conditions (e.g., inflation), which are not always problems for the business.

to obtain a lot of product information from a central location at their convenience. Many web sites have
employees who answer customers' questions in real time through chat-room and text-messaging
capabilities. High definition television (HDTV) and satellite radio are forms of media that communicate
information; however, they are expensive forms of media, and are limited in scope, depth of information,
and interactivity. Scanners are electronic tools that transmit paper copies of text and graphics into a

functions that allow the computer user to manipulate text. For example, the cut function allows the user to
select a block of text and remove it from a certain location. By moving the curser to another location and
selecting the paste function, the user can place the previously cut text into a different part of the
document. This process eliminates the need to delete text and retype it in a different section of the
document, which can be time consuming. The copy function copies the selected text but does not
remove it from its existing location. If the text is not copied before it is deleted, then it would not be

Bomb threat. Emergency situations usually occur unexpectedly. Therefore, business employees should
know how to handle and report them even if it is unlikely they will occur. An example of an emergency
situation is a bomb threat. Although most businesses will never have a bomb threat, employees should
know what to do to be prepared if it happens. Internal theft, check fraud, and stolen identity are not
examples of emergency situations.

Support services. Support services are the technical or complicated activities that project members
cannot do themselves. After you decide what type of additional help you might need to complete the
project, you should identify the other people, organizations, and businesses that need to be involved in
the project. Maybe you need the help of trained professionals to use complex equipment or different
types of transportation. While determining the type of work that needs to be done, you might identify
technical equipment. However, it is possible that a member of the group knows how to use this
equipment. In many cases, it will not be possible to identify alternative tasks or replacement items. Then,
it will be necessary to locate support services.

Selecting vendors. Businesses often buy from several vendors, or ask several vendors to submit bids.
Therefore, an important step in the process of purchasing equipment and supplies for the business
involves selecting the vendors. Businesses often establish criteria for selecting vendors such as
reputation, quality of goods, delivery time, price, discounts, etc. Then, the business may decide to use
the vendors that meet the criteria. Reviewing revenues, monitoring competitors, and visiting trade shows
are not important steps in the purchasing process.

To minimize errors. Quality control involves ensuring the degree of excellence of a good or service. Most
businesses use some type of quality control method at work in order to achieve excellence and minimize
errors. Quality control methods vary depending on the type of business, but they are all intended to help
the business operate efficiently and correctly. An example of a quality control method might be having
two people conduct an inventory count to minimize the possibility that one person will make a mistake.
Businesses do not use quality control methods to organize employees, attract vendors, or guarantee
safety.

$526,750. A fixed cost is the sum of all the costs incurred by a business that usually remain at the same
level no matter how many units of a product are produced or marketed. Fixed costs include rent, salaries,
insurance, advertising, and the cost of maintaining a web site. Bonuses are a type of variable cost
because they increase or decrease in proportion to sales volume. In this example, add the cost of rent,
salaries, and maintaining a web site to determine fixed costs ($423,500 + $88,000 + $15,250 =

situations, applicants should ask interviewers to buy their services (labor). Mr. Murray will doubt

employees how to correctly use the software. In some situations, employees might attend a class or
workshop off site at a training center. Understanding the company's policy manual, interpreting a
quarterly sales report, and analyzing the results of a research project do not require special training from
a source outside the company.

Trade shows. A trade show is a promotional method that many businesses use to introduce new

businesses the opportunity to display their products and meet with a large number of potential and
current customers. Many businesses spend a significant portion of their promotional budgets on trade
shows because they are an effective promotional method. Cash rebates involve returning part of the
price a customer pays for a good or service. A sales contest is a way of motivating salespeople to
increase their sales performance. Free samples are offers of a small amount of a product.

guarantee product quality, safety, and uniformity. Businesses often set grades and standards for their

Encourage future sales. Product bundling involves combining goods and/or services and offering them to
customers as one product for a lower price than if the customers were to buy all of the products
individually. The reason why businesses bundle products is to get customers to try a product they would
not normally purchase. If the customers try the product, and like it, they might purchase the product as an
unbundled item at another time, which encourages future sales. Businesses do not bundle products so
they can limit returns, monitor promotional activities, or eliminate cash shortages.

Avoid selecting a name already in use by another business. When selecting a brand name, a business
should have several of its preliminary choices researched legally. Not only will this help the business
ultimately protect its chosen name, but it will also help to avoid selecting—and becoming attached to—
names that other businesses may already legally own. Legally researching names will not help avoid
names that are unpleasant, nor will it help to stimulate consumers' buying habits. Other types of
qualitative, consumer-based, and secondary research can help a business learn these things about
potential brand names. The same holds true for determining if a name is adaptable to displays, signage,
and advertising.

Company web site, sales calls, and trade shows. A corporate brand is all of the combined impressions
and experiences associated with a particular company. A successful corporate brand involves developing
product and promotional mixes that communicate a desired image of the business. This communication
occurs through a variety of touch points. Touch points are the opportunities that the business has to
connect with customers and reinforce its brand. Some opportunities that the business has to
communicate and reinforce the corporate brand are through the company's web site and during sales
calls and trade shows. These opportunities involve the efforts of many of the company's employees,
including the sales staff. Compensation policies, sales reports, and marketing audits are not targetmarket

is the amount of satisfaction that the good or service will provide the target market. Slogans and logos

No" campaign were depicted as friends of the community. Primary product promotion focuses on creating
consumer demand for an entire class of goods or services. Secondary product promotion attempts to
create demand for a specific brand. Institutional public-relations promotions inform consumers of
controversial issues that are in the public's best interest as well as being related to the company or its

Pay a monetary fine to the government. When businesses fail to comply with government advertising

when the business ignores a cease-and-desist order. A comparative disclosure form is not a common
term used to describe government regulatory policies. A cease-and-desist order is a demand to stop
running an advertisement. A cease-and-desist order is issued by a governmental agency rather than a
business. An endorsement is an approval by a reputable external source.

which is the third element in the ad. For example, the headline should attract attention and lead the
reader to the illustration, which supports the headline. The coordinated headline and illustration create a
desire in the reader to want to know more about the subject of the ad and, therefore, to read the
message. It is not important to coordinate the headline and illustrations to make the reader appreciate the
style of layout, understand the company name, or be aware of the cost involved.

Participate in trade shows. When evaluating whether to participate in trade shows, businesses often take
into consideration the size of their sales staff and the amount of their advertising budget. For businesses
that have a small sales staff and a limited advertising budget, it is often worthwhile to participate in trade
shows because this provides the opportunity to contact a large audience of potential customers. The
trade show provides access to more contacts than the small sales staff can reach, and for less cost than
extensive advertising. A business with a limited advertising budget probably would not develop television
commercials or sponsor major sporting events because of the high cost associated with those activities.
Buying space on billboards usually is not effective for businesses that sell to other businesses.

Demographic trends. Demographic trends refer to the direction the population is moving in terms of
physical (e.g., age) and social (e.g., income) attributes. These external characteristics can affect the
manner in which a business plans its promotional activities. For example, a large portion of the
population falls into the baby-boomer age group. As this group reaches retirement age, its needs and
preferences change. Therefore, a business targeting its promotional efforts to this group needs to
consider these changes, and adapt the promotional strategies appropriately. Product lines, staffing
responsibilities, and pricing strategies are internal factors that affect a business.

salesperson should let the customer know that the service is available—it might be something that helps
close the sale. The example does not point out an obvious feature or exclusive want. There isn't enough
