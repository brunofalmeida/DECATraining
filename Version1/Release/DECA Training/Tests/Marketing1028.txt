Contract. Contracts are agreements among two or more parties stating that one party is to do something
in return for something provided by another party. If one business promises to do something for another
business in return for receiving compensation, the two businesses have a contract. Then, the businesses
are obligated to fulfill their part of the contract. In most cases, contracts benefit both parties, although
promising to do something in return for receiving compensation is not necessarily a benefit. A partnership
is a form of business ownership in which the business is owned by two or more persons. A guarantee is a
promise to the consumer that a product's purchase price will be refunded if the product is not satisfactory.

(EPA) in an effort to control and reduce pollution. The EPA enforces various laws and rules, some of

waste. Businesses are required to follow EPA regulations which often are costly to carry out. If
businesses fail to dispose of hazardous waste properly, they may be forced to pay expensive fines.
Counseling substance abusers, adapting to worker safety, and identifying natural resources are not
business activities covered by environmental regulations.

Indirect. Distribution that takes place through one or more channel members, such as supermarkets, is
indirect. The soft-drink company must sell its product directly to consumers if it takes a direct channel of

Extranet. Extranet refers to a computer network that connects certain businesses, and allows them to
collaborate and exchange information. Extranet technology allows the members of a distribution channel
to efficiently communicate. Businesses often use extranet technologies to monitor inventory, place
orders, and track shipments. A firewall is a computer security instrument. A filter is a computer software
program that screens and categorizes information. Intranet refers to the computer network that allows
employees to collaborate and exchange information within the business.

Reverse. Reverse distribution involves customers returning used products to the manufacturer. This
process allows businesses to retrieve products such as automobiles, refrigerators, and glass bottles in
order to reuse them, recycle them, or properly dispose of them. Reverse distribution is considered ethical
because it helps to save natural resources and protect the environment. Taking back used products and
recycling or disposing of them is not an example of internal, joint, or closed distribution.

Good customer service. Distribution is one of the marketing functions that must work with the other
marketing activities to get goods and services from producers to consumers. The goal of marketing is to
satisfy consumer wants and needs while achieving company goals. Businesses cannot satisfy those
needs and provide quality customer service unless all the marketing activities work together. For
example, businesses are only able to serve customers when they have the advertised items on hand and
at the right price. Not all businesses need or use product displays, provide free delivery, or offer flexible
credit terms.

Determining the major purpose of the communication. In order to write effective communications, the
writer must first determine what specific purpose (or purposes) the communication should serve. The
communication is then prepared in order to accomplish those specific goals. The writer determines what
details should be included and edits the communication to make sure that it is clear.

11. B
Straightforward. Writing information messages is a routine business activity. Throughout the day,
businesspeople write messages to transmit various types of information to other people in the company
or to other businesses. This type of routine information should be written in a straightforward way so that
it is easy for others to understand. Routine information should not be presented in a technical way
because it may be difficult for others to understand. Informational messages do not need to be
persuasive or attention-getting because they are merely passing on necessary information.

12. D
Logical evidence. Statements in a persuasive message should be supported with logical evidence. It is
not effective to ask customers to do something without providing supporting information. Facts and
statistics are types of logical evidence that have a positive impact on customers and help to support your
message. Logical evidence is much more effective than an educated guess or a personal opinion
because guesses and opinions may be inaccurate. Using simple language is a writing technique that
does not necessarily support your statements.

Complaining. These customers believe that everything is going wrong for them and that everyone is
either taking advantage of them or not really trying to help. Leave-me-alone customers prefer or pretend
to prefer to be left alone to find what they want. Suspicious customers question everything and may want
facts and proof before being convinced to buy. Slow/Methodical customers are those who require a lot of
time to make a purchase because of shyness or difficulty in making a choice or buying decision.

America. Therefore, it is often impossible to survey the target population. As a result, researchers identify
a sample of the target population, which is an accurate segment of the entire population. By surveying
the sample, researchers can obtain a fairly accurate representation of the target population. The
business community, the mass audience, and the general market might be the target population
depending on the research and the specific research problem.

Consumer demand. For whatever reason consumer demand changes, producers respond by changing
supply. To balance supply with demand is one of the fundamental goals of the free market economic
system. Product utility refers to the usefulness of a product. Place utility is usefulness created by making
sure that goods or services are made available at the place where they are needed or wanted by
consumers. Both product utility and place utility affect demand.

financial condition of a business, and would indicate if there were funds available to hire more
employees. Strategic management is the process of planning, controlling, and organizing an organization

Reduced transportation costs. Many corporations locate their factories and businesses in foreign
countries in order to be close to their market. This, in turn, reduces transportation costs. It is less
expensive for companies to ship their goods regionally, rather than internationally. Low labor costs in
their home countries, lack of cooperative trade agreements, and unfavorable monetary policies are
reasons why corporations would keep their operations at home rather than locating them abroad.

Only traditional intelligence can be measured accurately with a written test. Although traditional
intelligence can be reliably measured with a written test, tests for emotional intelligence involve selfassessment,
and therefore are not so accurate. It is true that emotional intelligence can be learned, and
that traditional intelligence is a characteristic at birth. Emotional intelligence is used along with traditional
intelligence to describe the skills and abilities that are needed for career success. Finally, levels of
intelligence, either emotional or traditional, are independent abilities. In other words, a person can have
high emotional intelligence but average to below average IQ.

Understand your own needs. When you have self-esteem, you have a healthy appreciation for yourself,
your best qualities, and your finest achievements. Self-esteem acts as a pipeline through which all your
aspirations and goals can pass into real, achievable results. It means you accept and care about the
person you are no matter what mistakes you've made. When you brag about your accomplishments, you
lack true self-esteem. You should give yourself credit for what you do—not apologize and become
defensive when you have done a good job. When you fail, you become fearful, unsure, and dependent.
When you learn by your failures, you can be a success.

Emily could have used the money she spent on getting a new car on something else. Her opportunity
costs are not the reliability and luxury of a new car—those are benefits. Emily chose a new car over a

Track and record his expenses. Realistic personal budgets involve two important considerations—income
(money Marcel receives) and expenses (money Marcel spends). It is important for Marcel to track his
expenses because he needs to make sure that he has enough income to pay for his bills (e.g., rent,
utilities, car). To track his spending, Marcel should record his expenses in a central location so he can
see bill amounts and bill due dates. Recording and keeping receipts is also important for tax reporting
purposes and for tax auditing situations. Developing a realistic budget does not always involve verifying a
past credit rating or consulting with a bookkeeper. Marcel should develop a budget that will support his
ability to pay his bills on time.

businesses to reduce their prices or change their products. Foreign competitors can also be an economic
risk to domestic companies if they sell their goods for less than similar goods that are made in this
country. Perishability and weather are natural risks. Incompetence is a human risk.

Sales are the same. Businesses compare the categories in their profit-and-loss statements in order to
make decisions about spending. By analyzing the profit-and-loss statement, a business can find out if
sales are keeping up with expenses or if it is spending more in order to make the same amount of
money. If a business finds that its sales are the same and have not increased over a period of time, the
business might decide to decrease expenses in order to increase profit. Most businesses try to maintain
a steady cash flow, which is the movement of funds into and out of a business. If revenues are rising and
salaries are lower, a business probably would not need to decrease expenses.

Predict and control risks. Marketing information is all of the marketing-related data available from inside
and outside the business. It includes information about past situations and what is happening now. By
obtaining and using marketing information, business managers can predict the risks that might occur in
the future and take steps to control those risks. For example, if current marketing information indicates
that one product is losing popularity, a business can modify the product or repackage it to be more
appealing. As a result, the business might avoid losing customers, which is a future risk. Managers often
use marketing information to prepare documents and reports, but that is not an advantage of obtaining
and using the information. Business managers do not obtain and use marketing information to train and
direct employees, or to review and understand regulations.

Primary. Primary data are facts collected for use in one particular situation. They are gathered in a
systematic manner to solve a problem, explore an opportunity, or for any purpose useful to the business.
Some ways in which primary data are gathered include questioning salespeople, customers, or
competitors or hiring a marketing-research company to obtain the data. Secondary data are facts already
collected for some other purpose. Economic data are facts collected regarding the economy as a whole.
These data may be primary or secondary in nature.

Confidentiality. Confidentiality involves preventing the unauthorized disclosure of information. In the
process of collecting marketing information, researchers often obtain private and personal information
that is unethical to use or share with others without permission. Researchers need to respect client and
respondent confidentiality by making sure that the information they collect and use remains confidential
unless they receive explicit approval to reveal it to others. Standardization involves always performing a
task in the same way. Adaptability is the ability to adjust to changing conditions. Commercialization is the
point at which a product goes into full-scale production, the marketing plan is put into place, service and
sales training are done, and the product's life cycle begins.

Sampling. The process of choosing a representative group of consumers to survey is sampling. It is

Enter it into a computer for analysis. After a business collects marketing information from consumer
questionnaires, it processes the information to make it useful. Many businesses enter the data into a
computer that is able to tabulate, evaluate, or analyze the information according to specific criteria.
Simply gathering information from questionnaires will not be helpful unless the business analyzes it to
determine what it means and how it can be used. A business assigns a numeric value to the responses
in a questionnaire before distributing the questionnaire to consumers. Businesses usually do not organize
the information according to the date received, or arrange in alphabetical order the names of consumers
who complete the questionnaire.

Consumers buy between three and seven CDs per month. Range is the distance between the smallest

purchased and seven was the largest number. The distance between three and seven is the range.
Range is often used to describe the relation between numbers, such as the variation between the
number of CDs purchased. Mean is the average, such as consumers buying an average of five CDs per
month. Mode is the most common response, such as most consumers buy four CDs per month. Median
is the exact middle, such as half of all consumers buying more than five CDs per month.

Research objectives. A business provides a researcher with a market-research brief. The brief helps the
researcher determine the best way to obtain the needed information. The brief summarizes the
business's background, provides a statement about the problem or issue at hand (the purpose of the
study), and provides the research objectives. This helps the researcher understand what the business
wants to know before beginning the research process. A good marketing-research brief does not always
state the business's financial needs, nor does it state the researcher's mission statement. The report
findings are the research results.

Inconsistent collection method. Secondary data are information that have been collected for purposes
other than the project at hand. Marketers collect secondary data from a variety of sources, such as
business web sites, research companies, trade associations, and industry journals. Although secondarydata
sources can be inexpensive and provide current information, researchers must be careful to
examine the way in which the source collected information. If the source publishes statistical data it has
collected in an inconsistent or subjective way, the data may be skewed or exhibit bias. Industry approval,
reasonable prices, and Internet accessibility are advantages associated with secondary-data sources.

Observation. The observation research method is often appropriate to use when researchers want to find
out how employees interact with customers. By watching the interaction, researchers can study the
behavior of both the employees and the customers to determine if employees are behaving correctly. The
observation method provides information about what people do which may be helpful in analyzing how
employees treat customers. Interviewing employees will not necessarily provide useful information about
how they interact with customers. Personal is not a research method. The experimental research method
often involves testing new product ideas.

Downturn in the economy. A situational analysis involves examining and interpreting the environmental
factors that affect a business. As a result of considering external environmental factors, a business often
is able to identify potential threats in the marketplace such as increasing competition or a downturn in the
economy. Once a business identifies the specific threats, it takes steps to turn them into opportunities.
For example, if the economy is beginning to slow down, a business might revise its products or offer
additional credit plans to appeal to a wider market. A change in pricing structure, a contract with a new
supplier, and a decrease in operating expense are internal factors.

Production should decrease. Businesses need to forecast the amount of products they can expect to sell
in order to plan the most efficient production of those products. In this case, anticipated decreases in
sales should be matched by decreased production in order to meet the shift in demand. Increasing
production or keeping it at the same level will create too much inventory. The business might have to
reduce its prices in order to sell the inventory.

can use. The scanner, itself, does not store information, but enables computers to store it. Display
screens, or monitors, display the characters being keyed into the computer; they are not storage devices.
CD-ROMs are written during their manufacturing process; they cannot be used to store business
information since they are Read Only devices.

No longer needed. If a record isn't used for a long period of time and is no longer necessary, it is often
destroyed. Businesses usually are unable to keep every record and systematically review and destroy
those that are not vital to the operation. The fact that the record is no longer needed determines if it is
destroyed, not its age or storage location. Many records are not required by law, but businesses keep
them as long as they are needed.

Analyze the information. Most businesses maintain customer records that contain information about what
customers are buying, when they are buying, and how much they are spending. By analyzing this
information, businesses are able to plan future sales and obtain the products that will appeal to
customers and encourage them to buy. Without this type of information, businesses might have no idea
what customers will want to buy in the future, or how much they will be willing to spend. Businesses do
not maintain records about what customers are buying and how much they are spending in order to plan
an inventory count, offer quality service, or develop a quality environment.

Protecting consumer privacy. Businesses are becoming more concerned with ways of protecting
consumer privacy because of the new technology that makes it easy to gather and disseminate personal
information. The rapid growth of electronic commerce, which enables consumers to purchase products
online, also enables businesses to collect information about credit cards, personal preferences, and
buying habits that many consumers prefer to keep private. In response to a growing concern on the part
of consumers, businesses are trying to develop techniques that will protect consumer privacy—not only
online—but also from other types of abuses. Economic expansion and marketing research are
fundamental business activities rather than current trends. Private enterprise is an economic system in
which individuals and groups, rather than government, own or control the means of production.

Economic. An environmental scan is an analysis of external forces that influence a business's success.
The fluctuation of unemployment rates is an economic factor because unemployment has an effect on
consumers' ability to buy goods and services. If consumers are unemployed, they do not have income to
spend. As a result, businesses do not sell as much because consumers are not buying. When this
situation occurs, businesses often reduce expenses in an attempt to stay in business until the rate of
employment starts to rise again. The rate of unemployment is not a geographic, political, or cultural
factor.

Negotiate a long-term price. One of the advantages of placing a standing order is that the auto-parts
store might be able to negotiate a long-term price for the product. In many cases, the vendor will
guarantee the price if the store agrees to buy a certain quantity every week for a length of time. This is a
cost-effective way for stores to order products that are in regular demand because they can lock in a
price and be assured that a consistent supply of products is available. Some vendors supply attractive
point-of-purchase displays, but usually for seasonal or unusual products rather than products that need to
be delivered every week. Stores need to keep track of the inventory regardless of the type of ordering
system they use. Stores do not place standing orders to attract more customers, but to satisfy estimated
demand for products.

Semivariable. Semivariable costs are expenses that change very little and are not affected by sales
volume as much as variable costs. Fixed costs are going to remain the same no matter how many units
of a product are produced or marketed. Variable costs vary according to changes in sales volume or
sales revenue and can also change in proportion to the number of items produced. Nonoperating costs
are costs to the company for goods for which they resell or raw materials that are used to produce goods
or services to be sold.

You will waste a lot of time and effort. Without goals, you may put out a lot of time and effort without

Setting goals focuses your efforts in one direction, gives you a way to measure your progress, and
contributes to a high level of self-esteem.

Identify an appropriate career. In order to find out which career would be most appropriate for you, you
first need to know yourself. This involves identifying the things that interest you, as well as assessing
your skills, aptitudes, and other traits. Assessing your interests will not help you to increase your level of
ability. It also will not help in measuring work skills or improving study habits.

Provide a brief explanation of your qualifications for a job. A letter of application should be considered an
opportunity to convince the reader that you have the qualifications that match the job opening. Your
"sales pitch" should be briefly presented, saving the details for the job interview. You should avoid the
use of humor in application letters since you are writing about an important, serious topic. Educational
achievements should be stressed in relation to the job opening if you have little or no work experience to
discuss. The employer should receive a neatly typed, original letter of application.

Product management. Product managers create, test, and decide how a product will be packaged. They
direct and coordinate all aspects of the product. Advertisers develop messages and images to catch
customers' attention, inform them of products, and persuade them to buy. They use a variety of media to
communicate with customers. Some of these media are the Internet, radio, television, newspapers,
magazines, billboards, and catalogs. Marketing researchers are responsible for determining what
customers need and want and why customers do what they do. Distribution/Warehousing careers are
responsible for physically linking products with consumers by transporting and storing products.

making telephone calls or by reading the newspaper or a catalog.

Agreeing on the price of a certain product. Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which
businesses agree on prices of their goods or services, resulting in little choice for the consumer. An
example of price fixing is all of the local companies in the same business agreeing on the price to charge
for a certain product. Customers will pay the same price regardless of the company because all of the
companies are charging the same price. Charging different customers different prices for the same
product is price discrimination. Selling one product below cost is loss-leader pricing. Putting pressure on
customers to buy an expensive product is high-pressure selling.

Economic growth. In times of economic growth, both individuals and business increase their spending,
which increases demand. When demand is higher than producers can meet, prices go up. During times
of economic growth, people have more money to spend and are willing to pay higher prices to purchase
the goods and services that they want and need. As a result, the selling price often increases. High
unemployment, elastic demand, and an abundant supply are factors that often cause a decrease in the
selling price of goods and services.

Packaging. Packaging is placing the product in a protective wrap or container before it is offered for sale.
It is an area of product management that has increased in importance as the number of items available to
consumers has increased. The package must be eye-catching in order to attract purchasers. It must also
protect the product, create a product image ranging from economy to luxury, and identify the product
brand. Good packaging helps to increase sales. Labeling provides information about the product and
attracts customers but does not protect the product. Idea generation is the process of thinking up or
creating new plans, schemes, and thoughts. Concept testing is exploring the concept, or idea, for a
product in order to obtain feedback.

Maturity. Maturity is the stage in the product life cycle in which sales peak and profits increase. However,
many businesses are competing for those sales because the product is popular and in demand.
Businesses expect to make money selling products in the maturity stage, but they realize that they will
need to be competitive. During the introduction phase of a product, a business is more likely to lose
money than to make it. Universal and existing are not stages of a product life cycle.

Increases efficiency. A database stores all of a business's records and information in a central location. A
business uses computer databases to store sales records, financial information, inventory status
information, etc. By storing the information in a networked computer system, employees can quickly
obtain the same information at the same time, which can increase the business's efficiency. Using a
computer database does not decrease product usage, increase (consumer) demand, or decrease order
accuracy.

To avoid legal liabilities. Product liability has become a major problem for many companies. Rather than

Cable television and Internet fees cost consumers less when the services are purchased together rather
than if they are purchased individually. Mixed product bundling is the practice of packaging different
products together. Businesses often price the packages so that customers pay less for bundled items
than they do if they purchase each item separately. Telecommunication companies often engage in
product bundling practices by pricing packages for their services (e.g., Internet, cable, installation) for a
lower amount than if the customer purchased each service individually. When a manufacturer gives its
distributors lower prices for purchasing large quantities of a single item, it is called a discount. Coupons
and cereal samples are examples of sales promotion. Laundry detergent that is not packaged with other
items is not considered an example of product bundling.

Perceive. Product positioning is the customer's image or impression of a product as compared to that of
competitive products. A product's image influences how a customer views or perceives the product.
Outsource refers to the practice of acquiring assistance from outside organizations or consultants to
obtain goods or services to accomplish business objectives. Positioning does not necessarily affect how
a person uses a product. In many cases, there is only one purpose or way to use a product, regardless of
the way that it is positioned in the marketplace. Trade is defined as the process of exchanging one
good/service for another.

Stereotyping. A stereotype is a set image or an assumption about a person or thing. When an advertiser
stereotypes a person or group of people, there is an assumption that the entire group always behaves in
a certain way, which isn't always true. Therefore, stereotyping is often viewed as treating people in an
unfair manner, and can evoke ethical issues. Puffery is the practice of using exaggerated expressions to
describe a product or its features (e.g., "the best"). Sexism involves stereotyping people on the basis of
gender. Libel is defined as a written or published statement that portrays an entity in an unfavorable way.

Advertising. Word-of-mouth communication is promotion and publicity for a business provided by
customers who tell others of their satisfaction with the business. It is a type of advertising because it
spreads the word about the business to other audiences and potential customers. Many businesses
encourage word-of-mouth advertising because it is an effective way to promote the business. Marketing
is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to
customers and for managing customer relations in ways that benefit the organization and its
stakeholders. Retailing involves buying consumer goods or services and selling them to the ultimate
consumer. Prospecting is the act of identifying any person or organization with the potential to buy a
product and compiling that information in an organized manner for future use.

media.

message of the advertisement. Providing examples, descriptions, or reactions does not coordinate the
copy with the headline.

involves monitoring pending legislation, working with lawmakers to explain the industry's position, and
encouraging the passage of legislation that is favorable to the industry. The goal of lobbying is to
establish good relations with government to benefit the business or industry. Advising and counseling are
public-relations activities that involve working with management of the business. Writing is usually the
responsibility of copywriters.

Promotional program. A promotional program is a framework for the promotional activities of a business.
Participating in trade shows is a promotional activity because it involves a business displaying and/or
demonstrating its products to build sales leads and interest. The goal is to communicate information to
the target audience to encourage those consumers to buy. Trade shows are an effective promotional tool
because the consumers who attend are the most likely prospects for a business's goods and services.
An advertising campaign is a series of advertisements planned around a central theme. Direct sales
involve calling on customers. A sponsorship is a partnership in which a company pays a fee to affiliate
itself with a team, league, or event.

involves deciding what paths or routes goods and services will take from the producer to the consumer.

Ask appropriate questions and listen to each customer. Since each customer has different needs and
wants, the salesperson needs to ask questions about how the customer will use the product and
determine what is important to the customer (e.g., style, service, durability). Once the information is
obtained by the salesperson, s/he can determine the most appropriate product for the customer. Surveys
completed by past customers will not always indicate the needs and wants of current customers.
Brochures and literature are generally distributed to undecided buyers and are used as a follow-up tool.
Hidden benefits are generally explained after the salesperson has determined the customer's initial
