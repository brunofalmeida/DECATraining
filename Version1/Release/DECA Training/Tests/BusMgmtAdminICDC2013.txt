Defamation. A tort action occurs when one party (in this case, Frieda) brings a personal suit against
another party to gain money or other relief in exchange for any harm. In Frieda's case, her business
suffered after Shamir's untrue accusations were printed in the newspaper. Making false statements with
the intent of harming someone else (or their business) is known as defamation. Appropriation is the use
of another person's likeness or any other identifying characteristic without their permission. If Shamir had
used Frieda's name or picture in his advertising materials without getting her permission, that would be
considered appropriation. Negligence is an unintentional tort that occurs when a party doesn't live up to
duties and causes unplanned harm to another party. Shamir intended to cause damage to Frieda's
business, so this wasn't a tort of negligence. Wrongful interference occurs when a third party interferes in
a contractual (or business) relationship between two other parties.

Using a verbal acknowledgement response. In one-on-one or small group conversations like Megan's, a
short verbal response lets the speaker know you are paying close attention. By saying things like, “I see,”
or “Uh-huh,” you let the other person know that you're actively listening. Repeating critical information is
another important active-listening skill that involves repeating things like phone numbers, names, or web
addresses. When you paraphrase the message, you repeat what the other person said, but in your own
words. When you collect all the information possible, you observe gestures, interpret body language, and
listen to the person's tone of voice. All of these are important active-listening skills, but they aren't what
Megan is doing in this example.

Tell the caller you're happy to hear about his vacation, but you have to take another call. It's important to
be as professional and polite as possible, even if a talkative caller is taking up too much of your work
time. By saying something courteous yet assertive, like, "I'm happy to hear about your vacation, but I
have to take another call now," you're letting the caller know that you appreciate his personal stories, but
that you also have work to do. This customer brings money to your business, so you don't want to be
rude or risk offending him. You shouldn't tell the customer that you don't have time for him, even if he's
just telling personal stories. You also shouldn't transfer the call to another person, as that would be
considered rude both to the customer and your coworker. Although it's important to sound interested
when you're talking to a customer, you shouldn't talk to them for too long, especially not if you have
important work to do. It's necessary to strike a good balance between making a customer connection and
asserting yourself.

 4. D
Inductive organization. Inductive organization starts with examples, facts, or reasons and saves
conclusions for last. When you need to persuade someone of something, inductive organization can be
especially helpful. This is the case for Alexis and her team. She knows that her boss won't necessarily
want to spend a lot of time and money on the project, so she starts by listing the benefits. If she started
out with the costs, her boss would likely be scared off before she even had the chance to convince him.
Deductive organization is the opposite of inductive organization. It starts with the conclusion, and then
moves to examples, facts, and reasons. This method of organization is best when delivering routine
information or business writing. Chronological order presents information in time sequence. This is useful
when describing history or sales figures. Geographical order involves organizing your information around
location. This method of organization isn't used that often, since there aren't many topics that are easily
organized by location.

Requesting more information about a company. When you need to request information or ask a question,
you send a letter of inquiry. Letters of inquiry can be written for many different reasons—to request more
information about a company, to ask a question about a product, to inquire about a job opening, to ask
for advice, to request paperwork, etc. A letter that thanks a potential employer for an interview is a followup
letter, not a letter of inquiry. When informing employees of a payroll change, you'd likely write a
memo. A business report summary is known as an executive summary. This is meant for people who
don't have time to read the entire business report, and it's not the same thing as a letter of inquiry.

Feasibility report. A feasibility report summarizes the positive and negative consequences or implications
of taking a certain course of action. Troubleshooting reports address specific problems, such as a
problem with a process. A sales analysis is an examination of a company's sales for a certain period of
time. A request for proposal is an invitation that a business extends to suppliers to bid on a particular
project or program.

Problem statement. The problem statement is the heart of the research report—it defines the issue at
hand and summarizes the purpose of the research. In the example, the company defines the problem as
product-release failures due to understaffing. In a few additional paragraphs, the report writer should go
into more detail about the problem. The executive summary is an overview of the entire report. The
audience typically uses the executive summary to determine whether it is worthwhile to read the report
any further. The recommendations section is the proposed course of action and is the last component
presented in the report. A pronouncement (statement) of intent is an agreement to do something.

A description of the sampling plan and research technique. A research report is a written document that
summarizes an investigation of a particular issue or problem. The methodology section of the report
outlines the research plan and includes a description of the sampling plan, research technique (e.g.,
survey or interview), research procedures, and reliability of the results. The purpose and significance of
the study appear in the introduction section of the research report. References appear at the end of the

Memo. If Sophia needs to transmit a message to her staff that involves lots of numbers and figures but
doesn't require much explanation, a memo is her best bet. This way each employee will have a record of
the information to keep on file. A face-to-face meeting would be an inconvenient way to transmit the
necessary information. Sophia would waste valuable time going over each figure, when employees could
just as easily read the information themselves. A conference call and voicemails would also not be ideal.
With either of those options, the employees wouldn't have the information in front of them. The numbers
would also be confusing to explain over the phone. It's always important to choose the correct
information channel. If Sophia chooses the wrong one, she could confuse her employees or distort the
message.

Brand promise. A business's brand promise is its (spoken or unspoken) agreement with its customers
that it will consistently meet their expectations. When Patricia's customers visit her business, they know
they'll receive outstanding customer service every time. A brand promise should go above and beyond
goods and services and focus on something other businesses don't offer. For example, the other auto
repair shops in town may do repairs that are just as good, but it's Patricia's outstanding customer service
that sets her apart. A tagline is a company's slogan. Taglines often change based on marketing
campaigns and cultural shifts, but a company's brand promise is permanent. A vision is the future a
business desires to create. Providing great customer service may be part of Patricia's vision, but that
alone is not a vision. A mission statement is a brief summary of what a business owner wants to be
doing. This is not the same as a brand promise.

Advocacy. Word-of-mouth promotion and referrals to other potential customers are known as advocacy.
This is what Simone uses when she relies on happy customers to spread the word about her business.
Advocacy is a main goal of customer experience management (CEM). Relationship buying occurs when
customers find businesses they like and stick with them. Instead of shopping around, they prefer to stay
with the business they currently patronize. Corporate culture refers to the values and ideals that an
organization encourages among its employees. Business process management focuses on aligning a
business's objectives and activities with customer needs by stressing innovation, flexibility, and most
importantly, technology.

Operational. Operational risks are the possible events and situations that can result from employee
actions, core processes, and daily business activities. Unfortunately, people and processes aren't perfect
—as long as a business deals with people, it will always have some degree of operational risk. Take
Nadia's employee Roger, for example, whose human errors are considered operational risks. Hazard
risks are potential events or situations that can cause injury or harm to people, property, or the
environment. Most hazard risks can only cause business losses, not gains. Strategic risks are broad risks
that often concern the overall business environment. Financial risks are possible events or situations that
directly influence a company's cash flow.

Income tax. Income tax is based on the amount of money you earn. Because of income tax, part of each

Property tax is a tax on real estate and personal possessions. Sales tax is a tax on the sale/exchange of
goods. Sales taxes are placed on most retail transactions. An excise tax is a type of sales tax that's
placed on something specific, such as alcohol or tobacco. Excise taxes are typically either used on goods
that are harmful to consumers or commodities that are in short supply.

15. A
Structural. Structural unemployment occurs when workers' skills don't match up with the jobs available.
This often happens when there are technological advances, like in Randy's situation. Although he is a
skilled worker, the jobs available need a different set of skills. In Randy's case, his best option is to get
more education or training so he will have the necessary skills to become employed again. Frictional
unemployment occurs when the right jobs and workers just haven't been matched up. Unlike with
structural employment, there is a job that utilizes the employee's skills, but s/he just hasn't found it yet.
Cyclical unemployment happens when there's an overall decline in the economy. For example, when a
recession hits, fewer people are able to find employment. This is not the case for Randy, as there are
plenty of jobs. He just doesn't have the skills necessary for any of them. Seasonal unemployment is
predictable and expected in many industries. For example, teachers aren't usually employed in the
summer.

It encourages exports. A weak dollar is a dollar that's worth less than another (foreign) currency. A weak
dollar creates many disadvantages for the economy, but one advantage is that it encourages exports. A
weak dollar means that foreign currency is able to buy more goods. A weak dollar actually creates less
consumer spending because imported products become more expensive, meaning that consumers can't
afford to buy as much. Employee wages typically go down, since employers have to pay more for their
supplies. In addition, employers usually can't afford to hire new employees. In fact, they often have to lay
off workers.

Nonverbal communication. Nonverbal communication involves the use of gestures or facial expressions
rather than the use of words. The meaning of gestures and facial expressions vary by culture. As
described in the example, maintaining eye contact indicates interest in the American culture; however,
some cultures rarely maintain eye contact because they consider it a rude gesture. Social status refers to
a person's social class, which may be influenced by education, money, surname, title, occupation, and
geographic location. Clothing, makeup, and hygiene are issues that relate to appearance. Gender refers
to an individual's sex—male or female.

Dining etiquette. Because dining customs and traditions vary, foreign businesspeople should learn about
the proper dining etiquette before visiting another country. Researching a country's dining etiquette can
prevent embarrassing situations such as talking about business matters at an inappropriate time (e.g.,
dinner). Negotiating style is the manner in which a person behaves during the negotiation process.

Have a low tolerance for uncertainty. Cultures that have numerous rules and like to know what to expect

example does not indicate that Germans are highly ethnocentric, which is the belief that your own culture
is naturally better than other cultures.

Time. The concept of punctuality differs among cultures. In Japan, arriving late to an appointment
indicates a lack of consideration or importance to the other party. In business situations, a late arrival
may affect the ability to reach a business agreement. On the other hand, some cultures view the concept
of time differently. A businessperson might keep a client waiting because s/he wants to finish a task so
that the client has his/her undivided attention. Assertiveness is a communication factor. Decision making
is the process of choosing among alternatives. Location is a space or geographic consideration.

Is a hierarchical society. A hierarchy is a system in which people or groups have roles in society based
on authority, rank, or status. In the situation presented, each Japanese employee sits according to the
rank or position that s/he holds in the company, which is a characteristic of a hierarchical organization.
Because the Japanese culture embraces this attitude in other aspects of day-to-day life, such as family

standards. A collectivist culture is a society that values a strong and loyal group orientation. Japan is a

Estimate the time that it takes them to perform their tasks. When businesspeople estimate the time that it
takes to perform their tasks, it helps them to plan, prioritize, and manage their workloads effectively.
Planning their work helps businesspeople avoid scheduling activities too close together, which can affect
the quality of their work. For example, if it takes a businessperson one hour to prepare a status report
that is due at 4:00 p.m., s/he should not start the report at 3:30 p.m. Because coworkers have their own
work commitments, they only should help in emergencies with management's approval. Pleasant tasks
are not always priorities for businesspeople. Taking shortcuts and performing work too quickly often
results in errors and low-quality work.

In group settings, diversity increases creativity and innovation. Diversity brings different views,
experiences, and strengths to the table. This is invaluable in a group setting. Think of it this way: If you fill
a brainstorming session with people who are exactly like you, you won't get any new ideas. However, if
you find people who have different backgrounds and experiences, they will likely have solutions you
might not have thought of. Diversity doesn't just apply to minorities, and it doesn't refer only to race or
ethnicity. Diversity includes everyone, which is why it's so important to learn to value diversity. Although
some people think that valuing diversity means ignoring or minimizing differences, that's not the case.
Instead, we should openly acknowledge differences and see them as assets, not problems. Diversity in
the workplace is actually greatly increasing. A few decades ago, the workforce consisted predominantly
of white males. Today, white males make up less than half the workforce in the United States. That's why
employees who value diversity are in high demand, and companies without them will find it difficult to
succeed.

knowing your role is primarily useful in group negotiations, where different group members may take on
different roles (such as "good cop" or "bad cop"). The walk-away point is the point at which it is no longer

Lack of task variety. Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension. Burnout is a
type of exhaustion that results from too much stress, which is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of
pressure or tension. Many things can cause stress and burnout in the workplace including inadequate
compensation (pay), unrealistic deadlines, little control over work assignments, and monotony. Monotony
involves performing the same task repeatedly, which often leads to boredom, indifference, and a lack of
motivation. When workers lack a variety of challenging tasks or assignments, they are more likely to

Feasibility. Feasibility is the achievability of a goal. If Hector can demonstrate to his team member that
the project truly can be done within their time frame, she'll feel much more motivated. Desirability is also
an important factor in increasing motivation, but even if a project seems valuable, employees won't be
that motivated if they think it's impossible. They may give up easily if they see the project as a losing
battle. Although it's wise to let employees know why a project is important, it's more important to first
make sure they know that it can be done. Rewards are also important, since they let employees know
that their work is recognized and appreciated. This often makes employees look forward to working on
future projects, but in the case of this project, the first priority is making sure team members see the
feasibility.

Margaret's company wants to be the best sporting goods store in the country. Organizational vision refers
to the future a company's leaders desire to create. Margaret's plan for her company's future is considered
an organizational vision. A team vision complements an organizational vision, but it's more tailored to
specific work tasks. Penelope's departmental plan, for instance, is considered a team vision. Franco's
desire to get his project done by the end of the week is considered a goal, not a vision. His goal is likely
part of a larger team or organizational vision. Omar's plan to increase his shoe store's sales is also
considered a goal. Goals are typically short-term, while visions are long-term.

Credit union. Amira would likely be happy banking with a credit union. Credit unions are not-for-profit
financial institutions that are owned by their members. Because of this, they have the customers' best
interests at heart. They also usually have better interest rates and lower fees than some other types of
financial institutions. If Amira enjoys doing her banking in person, an Internet bank would likely be a bad
choice for her. Internet banks do all of their transactions online. Amira also wouldn't be happy with a
commercial bank. Although commercial banks offer a wide array of services, they do not always offer
good interest rates. Investment banks don't accept deposits, so they wouldn't be a good choice for Amira.
Instead of dealing with the general public, investment banks typically work with businesses.

No, because it's a conflict of interest. Since Liana knows everything about the business's financial
information, it's unethical for her to buy stock in the company. It's considered a conflict of interest for her
to own stock in the company she's auditing, as this affects her objectivity and independence. She has a
vested interest in making sure that the company's financial records are good, since she stands to profit.
Embezzlement is when someone steals something that's been placed in his or her care. Although owning
stock in the company she's auditing would be unethical, Liana wouldn't actually be stealing anything. Just
because Liana tells the company about her stock doesn't make it ethical. She may think that she will be
able to keep her personal investing and her work life separate, but it's still a conflict of interest that she
should be careful to avoid.

Liability. Liabilities are the financial obligations a business has. In Claudia's case, the money she still
owes on her office equipment is considered a liability. To find the net worth of her business, she must
subtract her total liabilities from her total assets. This gives her an accurate picture of her business's
health. A liquid asset is cash or any asset that can be quickly converted into cash. Accounts receivable
are money owed to the business for purchases made by customers. Dividends are sums of money paid
to investors or stockholders as earnings on investments.

Evaluated. An effective budget is one that is evaluated regularly. The real value of a budget comes in
using it to assess the company's progress in achieving its goals. A budget must be evaluated from time
to time to move the business forward. Budgets should not be optimistic; rather, they should be realistic.
It's important to base budgets on realistic estimates. If a business isn't honest with its budget, the budget
won't be very helpful. Because budgets are estimates, it's crucial that they remain flexible. There will
always be factors outside a business's control that may require a change in the budget. Budgets
shouldn't be secretive; instead, they should be clearly communicated with all employees. When each
person in the company is aware of his/her effect on the company's profits, s/he will be more motivated to
be cost-conscious.

Job specification. A job specification is an explanation of the skills, knowledge, and characteristics
required for a job. It describes what a person in that position should be. When Latisha lists the education

explanation of the responsibilities and tasks associated with a specific job. It describes what an employee
in the position does. If Latisha wrote a job description for the nurse position, she would explain the actual
duties of the job. Strategic planning is long-range planning (about three to five years) for the company as
a whole. Onboarding activities are part of the staffing process and include employee orientation and

Organizational culture. Tacit knowledge is expertise that is often difficult to explain or quantify.
Businesses with positive work cultures tend to encourage openness and sharing, which builds trust
among employees. When coworkers trust one another and feel valued by their employers, they are more
likely to share their tacit knowledge with one another. Negative work environments tend to foster a
distrustful environment, which often discourages employees from sharing their expertise. In these
situations, employees are often fearful about losing their jobs and are more likely to keep helpful
information to themselves. Economic conditions, public agendas, and regulations are external factors that
affect business activities.

nondisclosure agreement is to provide businesses with legal protection if a competitor attempts to use

Participating in a community of practice. A community of practice is an informal group that is formed by
people who have common interests. In communities of practice, group members share ideas, discuss
problems, and brainstorm solutions. By doing so, the group members are transferring their knowledge
among themselves. One or all members can capture and record the collected knowledge for future
personal or group use. In the example, Jack and his friends share a common bond because all of them
work in technology. When the group met, Jack's friends offered suggestions for resolving his work
dilemma; therefore, the group is a community of practice. Groupthink is a situation that occurs when
conforming to the group becomes more important than expressing individual judgment and ideas. A
strategic alliance is an arrangement that involves two or more businesses entering into a relationship by
combining complementary resources such as technology, skills, capital, or distribution channels for the

Achieving stability. As Dahlia knows, starting a new business isn't easy. Many businesses fail soon after
opening. So, for many start-up companies, achieving stability is a main goal. Other goals can come later,

considered expansion. Dahlia will probably consider expanding in the future, but for now she needs to
focus on achieving stability. The same is true of developing new goods and services—later on, when
Dahlia has developed a strong customer base for the goods and services she already has, she may want
to consider developing new ones.

Summarizing. Quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing are all ways to incorporate another writer's work
into your own. Although they are similar, there are key differences among them. Quoting occurs when
you use someone else's text word-for-word. Paraphrasing involves using a section of the source material,
but putting it into your own words. What Reese is doing is summarizing—putting the ideas in the source
material into his own words but including only the main points. His summary will be much shorter than the
original text, since he's only including the most important information. Quoting, paraphrasing, and
summarizing are not the same as plagiarizing. Plagiarizing occurs when you use someone else's words
and don't credit him/her. That's not what Reese is doing, since he's being careful to cite the original

Encrypt the information customers give you online. It's important to make sure that someone can't easily

Although it's a good idea to make sure some records are easily accessible to all employees, customer
records should be off-limits for most people. Keep computers password-protected and file cabinets
locked to ensure that everyone won't have access to your customers' personal information. You

it's too late for Ruben to be trained if his coworker is already injured. That's why calling an emergency

repairs and unexpected downtime. Instead of allowing only outside technicians to maintain equipment,
it's better to train everyone in the office to follow the maintenance schedule. This way, when you run into
problems, anyone at your company will be able to fix the equipment, and you won't have to spend the
money to call in an outside technician. Although it's tempting to use the cheapest supplies you can find,
sometimes you really do get what you pay for. Cheaper supplies often end up breaking down faster, so

She's looking at her alternatives from a neutral point of view. If Christine makes her decision based on
logic, she compares and contrasts information, apart from personal involvement or emotion. By logically
choosing a new computer, she is looking at her alternatives from a neutral point of view, instead of from
her own (or someone else's) perspective. If she listens to her friends' opinions, then she is being
influenced by framing, not logic. Logic involves making a decision objectively, not subjectively. Christine's
decision won't be influenced by how the situation is presented, as in framing, because she is focusing on
the facts.

The project manager can tell him what a real day on the job is like. Perry can gain many benefits from
doing an informational interview with a current project manager. The project manager can tell him what
his/her typical work day is like, what sort of education or training s/he had, what s/he likes or dislikes
about the job, and what sorts of skills it takes to excel in her/his position. Personal information like this
may help Perry decide whether or not project management is the profession for him. Perry shouldn't
assume the project manager will give him a job, although having a connection may come in handy when
he's job hunting many years down the road. The project manager will not be able to make Perry's
decisions for him; all s/he can do is tell Perry about his/his experience. It's probably not a good idea for
Perry to expect the project manager to help him with his application; after all, it's a pretty big favor to ask
someone to speak with him. He should make sure not to ask too much of the interviewee. He also should
make sure to write a thank you note.

Dear Mr. Martinez. Even if the interview was fairly casual, it's always better to err on the side of formality.
If Javier isn't sure whether he should refer to his potential employer as Mr. Martinez or Dan, he should go
with Mr. Martinez. It's very unlikely that his potential employer will take offense to that, but he may take
offense to being referred to by his first name. Starting a thank you letter with “Hi Dan” is definitely too
informal. It's important to send follow-up letters after every job interview. This includes casual interviews,
interviews that didn't go well, and interviews for jobs you don't think you want.

Take a course in teamwork and communication. While education and experience are certainly important
when it comes to career advancement, soft skills can sometimes be even more important. These include
skills like communication, teamwork, attitude, conflict negotiation, problem-solving, and adaptability.
These aren't technical skills, but they can make the difference between a good manager and a bad one.
Marjane's manager wants her to improve her soft skills before he promotes her, so she should focus on
learning about things like teamwork and communication. She can do this by taking a course, asking a
mentor at work to help her, or taking on a volunteer project where she can work on these skills. Either
way, Marjane's boss will probably be pleased to see her take the initiative. Getting an advanced degree
and becoming proficient in a new computer program are technical skills. These may be valuable, but they
aren't the soft skills that Marjane's boss wants to see. Getting another year of experience won't help
Marjane if she doesn't focus on learning about teamwork, communication, and other soft skills.

Vice president of manufacturing. The chain of command defines the level of authority in a business and
specifies the individual who supervises particular employees. The advantage to having a chain of
command is that it provides the business with structure and organization. Large companies often set up
their chain of command by department. For example, the production manager of a tool manufacturing
company would likely report to the vice president of manufacturing. The quality control line supervisor
would most likely report to the production manager. The director of purchasing manages the business's
purchasing department. An operations assistant provides administrative support for the operations
function of the business and would most likely report to the operations manager.

Statement of work. The statement of work (SOW) is a document that outlines the terms, commitments,

Micromanage the project. Micromanagement occurs when the project manager excessively controls
project activities. This practice often involves making decisions that team members can typically make
themselves to perform and complete their work. Micromanagement tends to frustrate team members
because it hinders their ability to perform their work efficiently. To avoid this problem, projectmanagement
experts believe that the project manager should not provide too much detail in work
packages, which allows the team members to make basic decisions that affect their work. This, in turn,
frees the project manager's time to look at the “bigger picture” and address the major issues that come
up during the execution phase of the project. Project managers must allocate project resources
effectively to complete the project. Providing too much detail in work packages does not influence the
need to allocate project resources, simplify project deliverables, or develop a SWOT analysis.

Each work package should take between eight and 80 hours to complete. The 8/80 rule for dividing
project work packages states that no package should take less than eight hours or more than 80 hours to
complete. This rule intends to keep work packages in manageable units—not too small or too large.
Making changes to the WBS changes the project scope. The project manager may get input from others
when developing the WBS, but s/he does not need to get team members' approval. A WBS dictionary is
a tool that helps inform project team members about the scope, status, milestones, and deliverables
associated with each project activity. Team members do not develop the WBS dictionary after they carry
out their work tasks.

Conduct a post-implementation review. After the stakeholders receive the project deliverables, the project
manager develops a post-implementation review. The post-implementation review is a formal, detailed
assessment of the completed project in relation to the project's objectives. The document assesses the
project's budgets, deadlines, and processes, as well as the stakeholders' satisfaction with the results or
deliverables. The "lessons-learned" document summarizes the project's successes and failures. Project
managers often refer to the “lessons-learned” document when working on similar projects. A projectissues

the business, which cost the business future sales and profits. The employee's behavior did not affect

Monitor changes in laws affecting its business activities. Compliance with the law is an important aspect
of managing business risk. If a business does not monitor changes in the laws that affect its operations,
the business may become noncompliant. Noncompliance often involves paying government fines, which
are financial losses for the business. Environmental attorneys have specialized knowledge of laws that
affect the natural environment (e.g., pollution and water quality). The degree to which a business's
activities affect the environment influences the need to hire an environmental attorney. Businesses
purchase property insurance to limit losses related to buildings and land. Contract law is a category of
law that specializes in contracts or formal agreements. Encouraging all employees to understand the
advanced principles of contract law does not lower a business's noncompliance risks.

Increased errors. Staffing is the management function of finding workers for a business. An understaffed
business does not have enough employees to carry out the work. When employees have more
responsibilities than they can adequately handle, they are more likely to make errors, which is costly to
the business. An understaffed business often experiences high turnover because employees burn out
and find new jobs. A premium is an item that a business offers free to the purchaser of a particular
product. Understaffing a business does not typically affect the number of premiums that a business offers
