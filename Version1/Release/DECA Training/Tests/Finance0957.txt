1. B
Affects services and fees. As a result of the growth of international banking, many large banks now have foreign
branches and operate throughout the world. This means that they have an impact on the international financial services
industry. For example, a large international bank that does business in several countries affects the services that local
banks offer and the fees they charge. If an international bank offers unique services for free, the local banks often must
follow suit or risk losing business. Also, several international banks operating in the same city, such as New York,
impact each other and increase competition. Most international banks are regulated. Governments usually control
interest rates within their countries. International banking does not increase the value of investments.

A country banning exports to another country. An embargo is a total ban on specific goods leaving or entering a
country. It usually involves one country, or several countries, banning trade with another country, often for political
reasons. That means that the countries will not export goods to that country or import goods from that country. Many
countries place a tax, or tariff, on imports. A quota limits the amount of a good that can be imported or exported, but
this is not an embargo. Refusing to negotiate trade agreements is not an example of an embargo.

Research the problem. Proposals are intended to answer questions or provide recommendations to solve problems.
Business employees often need to research a particular situation or problem before they are able to write proposals.
After employees do research and gather information, they write proposals that explain the problem and the solutions.
The proposal is intended to persuade the business to follow the recommendations. Employees usually do not need to
analyze personal biases, contact the customer, or evaluate technical skills before they are able to write proposals.

Limit discussion time. If there are a lot of important topics on the agenda, a manager might limit discussion time on
each topic in order to cover all of the topics. This might involve opening the floor for 5 or 10 minutes of discussion or
stopping the discussion if it goes on for a long time. If the topic cannot be resolved in that time period, a manager might
table the topic and put it on the next agenda for continued discussion. The goal is to cover all of the topics while limiting
the meeting to a reasonable length of time. Presenting information in visual form will not ensure that all of the topics on
the agenda are covered. Staff meetings usually are an hour or so in length rather than all day. After covering all of the
topics, a manager might give participants an opportunity to provide additional feedback in written form.

business, and refunds to customers. Customers who receive excellent service are less likely to have complaints. Rapid

Domineering/Superior. Domineering/Superior customers often appear overly self-confident and pushy by boasting
about their purchases. Since these customers usually know what they want, they convince or sell themselves.
Disagreeable customers are unpleasant and hard to help because they are argumentative, complaining, irritable,
moody, insulting, impatient, and/or have a leave-me-alone attitude. Suspicious customers question everything and
want facts and proof before being convinced to buy. Slow/Methodical customers require a lot of time to make a
purchase because of shyness or difficulty in making a choice or buying decision.

10. D
Credit is expensive. When the money supply is tight, there is less money in circulation which means there is less
money available to loan. As a result, it is expensive to obtain credit because financial institutions usually charge high
interest rates on the money that is available. Many consumers and businesses put off borrowing money when the
money supply is tight. This also causes consumers to spend less, businesses to cut back on expanding, and
employment to decrease.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. This is a semiautonomous part of the U.S. Treasury Department, and the
office is appointed by the president for five-year terms. The Supreme Court does not play an ongoing role in the
financial services industry. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides insurance for deposits in both
banks and savings and loans. The Federal Reserve can issue currency, in addition to other powers, which allows for a
somewhat flexible money supply to best serve the needs of the country.

Gross domestic product. Gross domestic product is the final total value of all the goods and services produced within a
country's geographic boundaries in a year's time. The consumer price index measures monthly and yearly price
changes for selected consumer goods in different product categories. A leading indicator is a value which gauges the

Raising taxes. Many of the economic decisions made by governments have a significant effect on financial institutions.
Raising taxes is one of these economic decisions. When governments raise taxes, individuals pay more money, which
reduces the amount of money they have to spend on other items. This affects financial institutions because individuals
will not be able to save or invest as much, which means that the institutions will also have less money available to
invest or loan. Businesses that import goods from other countries are responsible for paying tariffs. Storing money and
monitoring exports are not economic decisions.

Stable economy. With a stable economy, the fluctuation in stock prices would most likely remain steady. Fear, time of
year, and positive or negative publicity affect the stock market. Fear and negative publicity cause investors to be
cautious and sell off stock. Investors put more money into stocks at certain times of the year. Positive publicity can
encourage investors to buy more stock.

Government. In communist command economies, the government is responsible for determining what will be

Expansionary. A fiscal policy is the government policy that sets levels of government spending and taxation. The type
of fiscal policy that a government uses depends on what the government wants the economy to do. For example, if the
economy is slowing down and heading into a recession, a government would use an expansionary fiscal policy to
encourage economic growth. To do this, the government might spend more and cut taxes to encourage businesses to
expand. Complementary, appropriate, and realistic are not types of fiscal policies that are intended to encourage
economic growth.

Interest rates. When interest rates increase, consumers often reduce spending, particularly on expensive items that
they finance or buy on credit. The higher interest rates make these purchases even more costly. When consumption
decreases, there is less demand for goods so production also decreases. The result often is a downturn in the
economy. Therefore, the level of consumer spending is a good indicator of the health of the economy. Personal needs
and family issues are not economic factors that cause consumers to reduce spending. Low prices often encourage
consumers to increase spending because they think they are getting more for their money.

Structural. Structural unemployment results when people have job skills but the jobs that require those skills do not
currently exist. For example, if new technology eliminates the need for certain types of jobs, the people who held those
jobs may be terminated. These people have skills, but the structure of the jobs has changed and they are no longer
needed. National unemployment affects workers throughout the country. If a business reorganizes, certain jobs may be
eliminated or combined, which may result in unemployment. Industrial is not a type of unemployment.

Payment record. Whether customers consistently pay their bills on time is an important factor in determining their
creditworthiness. Businesses that are considering making credit available to customers want to find out if those

credit because businesses expect that they will be repaid. Businesses do not consider a customer's marital status,
retirement plan, or education level when determining creditworthiness.

Add to the cost of the purchase. Using credit can add to the total cost of goods and services. For example, interest, or
finance, charges are added to accounts that are not paid in full at the end of each payment period. When customers
buy products with a credit card, they often pay over a period of time. Then, each month they pay interest on the unpaid
balance. The interest charges add to the cost of the purchase. Interest charges do not increase the retail price because
customers who pay in cash are not charged interest. Interest usually is calculated monthly rather than yearly. Interest
generates profit for the credit-card company rather than the store.

Investing in developing a new product. Investing in the development of a new product is a speculative risk because
there is a chance of loss, no change, or gain. However, if the new product is the type that customers want and will buy,
selling the new product has the potential of increasing a business's income. Businesses take risks when they invest in
new products, but they do so because they hope to earn a profit. Offering health benefits to employees is a pure risk
because the business can purchase medical insurance. Buying liability insurance is a way that businesses manage
pure risks. Businesses usually obtain insurance coverage to protect them from loss due to pure risks such as fire.

Aggressive growth funds. Aggressive growth funds are a type of investment that involves purchasing stocks whose
prices will increase substantially over a short period of time. These funds usually have a high rate of return; however,
they are risky because the price of the stock could drop suddenly. Those who invest in aggressive growth funds watch
the market closely in order to optimize the rate of return by selling the stocks when they are priced high. Government
securities are a very safe investment; however, the rate of return is usually low. Certificates of deposit have a set value.
Savings accounts are safe investments, but the interest rate may be low.

What they paid in taxes last year. Individuals who are self-employed usually make estimated tax payments because
they do not have an employer who is withholding taxes on a regular basis. These individuals are expected to make
payments that are as accurate as possible. Therefore, the amount they pay is usually based on what they paid in taxes
last year. If individuals expect their income to increase significantly, they should increase the amount of estimated tax
payments in order to avoid being charged penalties for underpayment. Individuals do not base estimated tax payments
on the funds available at the time, predictions of long-term income, or the difference between profit and loss.

To itemize deductions. By completing various tax schedules, tax preparers are able to itemize deductions and reduce

deduction allowed so the client saves money by itemizing and claiming the higher deductions. Tax preparers do not
complete various tax schedules for clients to calculate exemptions, to list allowances, or to determine wage rates.

Net worth. When determining a client's financial situation, financial planners usually estimate the client's net worth or

worth. The goal is to help clients increase their net worth. Liabilities are debts. Cash flow is the movement of funds.

might include payroll withholdings and required payments for unemployment compensation. Without an effective
system in place, financial institutions may not be able to adhere to a compliance plan. Financial institutions do not
develop a system to maintain and report information about income and expenses in order to follow an investment
strategy or determine a way to diversify. It is not possible to eliminate all risk.

Interest rates. Businesses often need to raise additional capital, or funds, to cover unexpected expenses or to make
large investments. One way to raise capital is to obtain a bank loan. However, before obtaining a loan, businesses
should consider the interest rates that they will be charged for the use of those funds. If the current interest rate is high
and a business needs a five-year loan, the overall cost of the capital also will be high. Businesses may decide that the
costs are too high and look for other ways to raise capital. Businesses usually do not pay legal fees when raising
capital by obtaining a bank loan. Trade credit involves obtaining short-term credit from suppliers. Cash flow is the
movement of funds into and out of a business.

occur." Assessing the importance of each cash flow to the business and releasing cash flows currently retained are not

Strengths and weaknesses. A business's financial strengths and weaknesses can be both internal and external.
Therefore, having accurate information about the level of sales and anticipated profits will help the business determine

Also, having information about the industry growth rate will help the business determine its external strengths and
weaknesses. If the industry has a steady growth rate, that is a strength for the business because it can anticipate that
its sales will continue to increase as the industry grows. Having accurate information about the level of sales,
anticipated profits, and the industry growth rate will not help to determine a business's financial policies and

Access cash quickly. Businesses acquire a variety of assets over a period of time. These assets include equipment,
property, investments in other companies, and cash. When determining the optimal mix and type of assets to acquire,
businesses consider their long-term financial needs because certain investments increase in value over time and add
to the net worth of the business. Businesses also consider the need to access cash quickly because some assets are
easier to convert to cash than others. For example, savings accounts are assets that businesses can access quickly in
order to obtain cash. Businesses want to develop the right mix of assets so they can access cash when necessary and
also increase their net worth. Property is an asset. Not all businesses issue stock dividends, but if they do, dividends
are expenses paid to others. Businesses do not determine the optimal mix and type of assets to acquire in order to
calculate income taxes.

Debt or equity. There are two types of financingdebt and equity. Debt financing involves borrowing money and
paying it back with interest. Equity financing involves raising funds by selling some of the ownership in the business.
When deciding how to raise funds, a business considers which type of financing will be more effective. If the business
needs additional funds for a short period of time, it is more effective to use debt financing and pay back the loan rather
than give up some of the ownership. However, if the business needs a lot of capital, it may be more effective to use
equity financing. Businesses weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both types of financing before deciding which
one to use. Banks and credit unions are sources of debt financing. Venture and angel are forms of equity financing.
Both debt and equity financing may be either public or private.

It should be used for profitable projects or invested, even for the short term. A large cash surplus is not productive for a
company, and is best put to good use in profitable projects or external investment opportunities. Unexpected events,

Preferred cash balance. Businesses usually establish a preferred cash balance which is the amount of cash that the
business always wants to have on hand. Cash in excess of that amount is available for the business to spend. If the
business estimates that it will have expenses that will cost more than the available cash, it usually decides to begin
financing activities in order to borrow money and maintain the preferred cash balance. When deciding when to spend
cash, businesses usually do not consider the estimated capital budget, projected interest rate, or required loan
schedule.

Needed cash. Factoring is a type of debt financing that involves selling accounts receivable for a discounted amount to
another company. The factoring company buys a business's accounts receivable for less than they are worth and then
collects the receivables. The business that sells its accounts receivable receives needed cash quickly rather than
waiting for customers to pay their accounts. Some businesses factor accounts receivable if they are experiencing a
cash-flow problem and need to obtain cash. Trade credit is another type of debt financing but it does not involve
factoring accounts receivable. Equity financing involves selling part of the ownership of a business to acquire capital.
Leverage is borrowing money to acquire an asset that will have more value than the cost of borrowing the money.

Trade credit. Obtaining short-term financing is sometimes difficult for new businesses because they do not have an
established credit history. Therefore, those businesses that buy goods from suppliers are often able to take advantage
of trade credit which makes it possible for them to pay for the goods at a later date, such as in 90 days. This amounts
to short-term financing because the business has the goods and also has time to generate the revenue to pay for the
goods in the future. Suppliers often are willing to grant trade credit to new businesses because it is a way of attracting
new customers. Venture capital, private investors, and public offerings are examples of equity financing that are long

Seamless coordination between manufacturers and suppliers. With "just-in-time" inventory management, supplies often
arrive only a few hours before they are needed. This cuts down on storage costs, causing the company to rely heavily
on a seamless coordination between manufacturers and suppliers. Although transportation logistics is important, it is
not the main factor in "just-in-time" inventory management. Sales performance and executive-to-employee
communication are also not central to the "just-in-time" inventory management system.

Handling and storing. The cost of inventory includes more than the cost of purchasing the items. It also includes the
cost of handling and storing the items, insuring the items, paying taxes on the items, etc. When businesses compute
the cost of inventory, they include all of these costs to obtain an accurate dollar figure for the costs associated with
maintaining an inventory. Shipping and transporting costs are included in the cost of purchasing inventory items. The
cost of inventory does not include the cost of preparing visual displays or of marking prices.

Financial plans. Projecting future operations involves forecasting the condition of the business in the future. This might
include projecting that sales will increase by a certain percentage, or that the size of the company will double, or that
the workforce will increase, etc. When projecting these operations, businesses also need to develop projected financial
plans in order to be prepared to fund the operations. If the size of the company will double, then there will be additional
expenses to pay. The business must plan to pay those expenses. When projecting future operations, businesses do
not develop projected tax schedules, stock options, or inventory methods.

Structure. A business can select either debt or equity as a source of capitalor a mix of both. The agreed-upon
selection or mix is called the firm's capital structure. A budget is an estimate of upcoming expenses listed by expense
category. Risk is the possibility of (financial) loss. "Capital model" is not a term used to describe a company's mix of
debt and equity. The Capital Asset Pricing Model is a tool used to analyze how risk and rates of return are related.

Analyzing variances. Standard costs are those costs that should be incurred if activities take place under normal
circumstances. Businesses use standard costs as a benchmark when comparing costs to determine if actual costs
varied from the standard. This process is known as analyzing variances. For example, if actual costs are higher than
standard costs, a variance exists. This might indicate a problem that the business should identify and correct in order to
bring actual costs in line with standard costs. Comparing standard costs with actual costs is not an example of
calculating expenses, estimating payables, or predicting returns.

Inventory. Inventory is often a major expense for a business because there is cost involved in buying and maintaining
an inventory of goods. Businesses evaluate inventory on a regular basis to control costs while keeping an adequate
supply of goods in stock. Businesses do not want to invest more in inventory than is necessary because that ties up
cash that could be used for other purposes. Credit, receivables, and interest are often sources of revenue.

Personnel record. Businesses maintain various types of information in an employee's personnel record because
information on each employee is vital to the business. Addresses must be kept current. Payroll records contain
information about the number of hours worked; regular and overtime earnings; and deductions for federal, state and
local taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and any other deductions. Job applications and performance reviews are
documents that usually are kept in an employee's personnel record. If the business provides insurance to the
employee, that type of information would be in the personnel record. Businesses often need to refer to the information
in personnel records for a variety of reasons such as considering an employee for a promotion, or in the event that an
employee was injured on the job.

Employees have different learning styles. A coach is a person who enables other people to reach their true potential by
helping them to overcome the barriers that are keeping them from doing something they want to achieve. Managers
often take on the role of a coach to help their subordinates to reach their career goals, to increase their productivity,
and to solve problems. Because employees have different skills and personalities, they learn information in different
ways. An effective coach realizes these differences and works to tailor a coaching relationship that works best for the
employee. Often, coaching requires that the manager spend more time with one employee than with another
employee. Increases in an employee's productivity rates do not always happen quickly when a manager uses coaching
in the workplace. Positive feedback is as important as constructive criticism when a manager coaches his/her
employees.

To forecast future sales. Businesses maintain a variety of records about the quantities and types of products that
customers are purchasing. These records are usually known as sales records. By analyzing past sales records,
businesses can determine what customers are buying, when they are buying, and how much they are buying. This
helps a business forecast future sales so it can be prepared to offer the products that customers want. Businesses do
not maintain records about what customers are purchasing to develop new displays, plan credit programs, or organize

Internal records. Companies keep many types of internal records about their various business activities. These records
might contain information about sales, agreements with vendors, financial status, etc. Management and employees use
the records to make decisions about day-to-day and future actions. For example, records that indicate that sales are
increasing and the company is profitable might encourage the business to decide to expand. Businesses monitor their
activities on an internal basis. Therefore, they would not monitor trade publications, industry trends, or government
statistics in order to keep track of what they are doing in the business.

services that result from combining inputs. Most businesses want to increase outputs rather than reduce them. Not all

primary purpose for analyzing and updating its procedures.

developing charts that list each project activity, who is responsible for the activity, and when the activity should be

interviewers to stop what they are doing, thus taking unnecessary time away from their jobs. The follow-up letter could

Product profitability. Consumer demand and product profitability go hand-in-hand in determining what goods or
services to offer. First, financial institutions must know their markets and what consumers want and need to buy. But
offering the most wanted product in the world would be useless if the product itself is not profitable for the organization.
So, the product must also be priced in a way as to be attractive to consumers but also cover expenses and deliver a
profit margin. Sometimes, financial institutions get distracted by the overall "likeability" of a product or whether the staff
will accept it. The staff will accept any product that is sound and that customers respond to. Product longevity is
another factor financial institutions fall prey to in determining products to offer. Simply having been around for a long
time is not a good reason for continuing to offer the product.

Financial goals. A financial plan is a road map, of sorts, that guides individuals from Point A to Point B, or from where
they are to where they want to be financially. Financial plans begin with establishing clear and measurable objectives,
such as having sufficient income to pay for college or retirement. Once goals are established, a financial plan then
outlines steps for achieving those goals and measuring progress along the way. Significant wealth could possibly be
one of the goals an individual wishes to accomplish, but it is not, in and of itself, the purpose of a financial plan.
Financial plans are not designed to help individuals achieve a financial career. Financial plans are not intended to

Need. A common objection occurs when there is a conflict between a "want" and a "need." Even though customers

Mutual funds. A mutual fund is an assortment of diversified stocks and bonds that may be purchased by individuals or

specific stocks. In most cases, the stocks that make up the mutual fund have been carefully evaluated in order to
provide the best possible return on investment. An investment company might recommend that a business invest
retirement money in mutual funds because the funds are safe and will increase in value over the years. A certified
