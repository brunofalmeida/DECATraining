Many hotels take advantage of positive cash flow to make improvements in the property or to put aside some funds to cover expenses during slow times.  Hotels would not use excess funds to buy personal items.  Smart hotels do not spend all available cash, but save some for emergencies.  Purchasing excess supplies is not a good use of extra funds because the hotel will have storage costs.

Posting machine.  A posting machine is used to produce accurate records of all the charges incurred by a hotel guest.  A posting machine lists each transaction such as room charge, meals, and tax and calculates the total.  A credit-card imprinter is used to make an imprint of a guest's credit card.  A calculator is used to total the amount of charges.  A cash register is used to ring up charges.

Past performance.  The amount of money that a motel allocates to its various categories must be based on realistic estimates.  Established motels usually base their estimations on past performance.  By comparing past forecasts, sales records, and expense records, motels will be able to determine if their budgeted figures are realistic.  New motels that do not have past records often rely on governmental information, competitors' activities, or industry data in order to develop realistic budgets.

Committed, involved, and take responsibility for quality.  Executive-level managers are both committed and involved.  They take responsibility for quality and do not delegate that responsibility.  This is a characteristic shared by organizations with a quality culture.  The alternatives remove the responsibility for quality from the executive-level manager and delegate it to others.

Safety and security are increased for guests and property.  In an electronic key system, lock combinations are controlled by computer and are changed for each new guest.  Installation costs for an electronic key system are higher than those for a traditional system.  Guests may lose the cards as easily as they do keys, but a new card can be issued and the old card canceled more easily than locks can be changed and new keys made.  The number of employees may or may not be affected by the type of key system used.

Including it as a file attachment or by pasting it into the body of the e-mail.  If the sender is unsure of the receiver's ability to read a document type, pasting the document into the e-mail is the best choice.  If main-taining the format is important and the sender knows the receiver can read the document type, a file attach-ment is best.  While rekeying is a possibility, the amount of time required makes this a poor choice.  Hyper-links lead to places on the World Wide Web or to other places in the document, so cannot be used to locate a file on either a local or network computer.

A competitor opens a property on the same block.  Speculative risks are risks that may result in a gain or a loss.  The proximity of a competitor may take away some customers but also may increase overall customer traffic as more people visit the area.  Theft, loss due to water damage, and loss of an order are examples of pure risks.  Pure risks are risks that may result in a loss but have no chance of gain.

Selecting the motel site carefully.  A motel owner's best defense is to select his or her motel site carefully and make sure that it is a secure building.  This also means considering the overall level of crime in the area.  Installing high-quality locks is a good defense, but locks are useless if someone untrustworthy has the keys.  Burglaries can still occur even when alarm systems are in place; burglars may be gone before the owner or police arrive on the scene.  Floodlights on rear entrances can make it difficult for burglars to enter a building, but lights may burn out or be easily broken, thus, defeating their purpose.

List of nearby medical facilities.  Resorts should be prepared in the event that guests have a medical emergency while staying on the property.  An effective way to handle such an emergency is to maintain a complete list of nearby medical facilities.  Then, if a guest becomes seriously ill, the resort can call the appropriate facility and obtain prompt care for the guest.  A selection of first-aid supplies will not be useful if the guest is seriously ill and requires the immediate attention of a trained professional.  Most resorts have simple medical equipment on hand, but not complex equipment.  Some hotel employees may have CPR or other medical training and might be able to assist guests in some situations.  However, seriously ill patients need professional attention.

Persons over the age of 40.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission administers the Age Discrim-ination in Employment Act which is designed to protect older persons in the workplace.  The act gives persons over the age of 40 some protection from certain arbitrary discrimination such as being fired for no cause.  For example, a business may not fire an older employee simply because of the person's age or because s/he is in a high-pay category.  Persons over the age of 40 receive some protection regardless of whether they earn minimum wage.  Temporaries and freelancers are not protected because they work on an as‑needed basis and are not considered regular employees.

The property will be required to pay damages to the individual for breaking a legal contract.  A room reserva-tion is a legal contract that entitles an injured party to compensation when the contract is violated, such as when a property does not follow through with its promise to provide a room.  A room reservation does not have to be in writing in order for it to be considered a contract; therefore, the individual is entitled to receive damages.  For a property to be considered fraudulent in the eyes of the court, it is necessary to prove that the property overbooks as a rule, rather than as an exception, when a special event is in town.  The ability to find a room elsewhere is not grounds for dismissing a case in which an individual is physically harmed as a result of being turned away by the hotel.

TDD device.  A TDD device is a type of telecommunications equipment that allows the hearing impaired to place and receive telephone calls.  Most hotels have TDD devices connected to the switchboard to accom-modate the needs of the hearing- or speech-impaired guests.  Switchboard operators need to know how to use the devices to communicate with all guests.  Switchboard operators do not use the hotel's fax machine.  Voice mail is a system of recording messages.  PBX is a type of switchboard.

The audience.  The type of audience is an important factor that hotel managers should consider when giving directions for completing job tasks.  The audience's educational level and amount of professional experience have an effect on how a manager will give directions.

This is true no matter what organization, profession, or industry is involved.

List of employees who will be promoted.  Certain information is considered confidential, and resorts expect employees who have access to that information to keep it private.  For example, information about planned promotions is confidential and should not be divulged until the resort is ready to make the announcement.  If an employee has access to this information or learns this information ahead of time, it would be unethical to tell others.  Available positions, dates of an upcoming event, and well-publicized expansion plans are not examples of confidential information.

Local warehouses.  Many national hotel chains that have locations throughout the country have distribution systems that involve the use of local warehouses.  Goods that are needed on a regular basis can be stored in local warehouses and sent to the hotel restaurants in the area when needed.  The use of local ware-houses enables a national chain to provide a continuous supply of goods to its various sites.  Air carriers provide a fast, but expensive, form of transportation and would be used for emergency shipments rather than for providing a continuous supply.  Shipping tags are attached to goods during the packaging process.  Mechanized devices are often used to lift, move, and rearrange goods.  Shipping tags and mechanized devices do not provide a continuous supply of goods.

$94.20.  The gross amount due on an invoice is the total due before shipping charges are added or discounts are deducted.  In this case, $94.20 is the gross amount due.  Shipping charges are added to the gross amount due to arrive at the total net amount of $100.95 ($94.20 + $6.75 = $100.95).  Then, the discount is deducted from the total net amount to arrive at the total after discount of $96.25 ($100.95 – $4.70 = $96.25).

Contamination and spoilage.  Foods that are not properly stored often spoil and become unfit to use.  Frozen foods should be stored in freezers and fresh fruits and vegetables in coolers in order to keep them from spoiling.  It is important to keep spoilage at a minimum because spoiled food may contaminate other food items or cause customers to become ill.  Restaurants do not store food in freezers and coolers in order to prevent inventory shrinkage, employee theft or pilferage, or shipping damage.

To market additional services.  Convention hotels have learned to take advantage of the prime marketing space in their lobbies.  Having current, attractive brochures displayed there provides customers an opportu-nity to browse and obtain information on other services in which they may be interested.  While customers may be interested in brochures in the lobby, they do not demand them.  They are more interested in the friendly, competent service the hotel provides.  Employees shouldn't be learning from these brochures.  They should already be familiar with the hotel's offerings and be prepared to answer customer's questions.  Hotels do not have brochure racks in their lobbies to establish hotel regulations.

Customer service.  Hotel chains often evaluate the performance of their independent reservation agents who are the channel members.  One of the criteria that chains use to evaluate channel members is customer service because the independent agents are the ones who actually deal with the customers.  Chains want to find out if their agents are performing well and providing the type of service that the chains expect customers to receive.  If they find that some agents are not providing the appropriate level of service, they usually try to provide assistance to help the agents improve.  A chain would not evaluate independent agents based on purchasing method, business plan, or operating policy.

Direct.  A direct channel of distribution occurs when a good or a service moves directly from the producer to the consumer (i.e., a property sells a room directly to a guest).  An indirect channel of distribution is one in which goods and services move from the producer to channel members then to consumers (i.e., if the property had used a travel agency or tour operator to sell the room to the individual).  An intermediary is a channel member (i.e., a travel agency or tour operator) operating between the producer and the consumer or industrial user to help in the movement of goods and services.  Middleman is another term for intermediary.

Gender.  Gender refers to a person's sex.  In many cultures, men and women do not have the same opportu-nities to participate in business.  In some countries, women have almost no opportunity to work outside the home, and they are permitted to hold only menial positions.  The culture and tradition of a country often has a strong influence on the role of men and women in business.  The culture often assigns certain roles to men and women that they are expected to follow.  A career is a person's occupation or work role.  Safety is free-dom from danger, risk, or injury.  Morale is the state of a person's attitude or outlook on life that affects his/ her approach to work.

Consumer trends.  A marketing-information management system can help hotels to discover new or expanded markets and to use them.  The system can gather and analyze information about consumer trends, target markets, changes in the environment, changing events, and the effects of these factors on consumers.  A characteristic of useful marketing data is that they should be up-to-date.  Historical data, therefore, would not usually be gathered.  Employee absences are a management, rather than a marketing, consideration.

To merge a variety of data into one database.  Ski resorts often obtain information about customers from a variety of sources such as questionnaires, comment cards, or sweepstakes entries.  All of this information is valuable if the resorts are able to merge it into a database that is easily accessible.  A resort's customer database might include information about name, address, types of recent accommodations, dollar amounts spent, general interests, income, dining preferences, etc.  Resorts use the merged database to target spe-cific customers or identify trends in order to remain competitive.  Resorts might purchase software in order to prepare questionnaires or direct-mail pieces that will be sent to customers, but not to manage marketing information.

Accessibility.  One advantage of using the Internet as a research tool is that computers are able to conduct searches and easily access volumes of information.  Marketing-information managers can indicate a specific topic and their computer systems will quickly search the Internet for all pertinent information.  People con-ducting the same type of research often become tired and bored and overlook many sources of information that would be useful.  Computers do not have that problem and perform exhaustive searches at high speeds.  Security and privacy are some of the problems associated with the Internet because anyone with Internet access can obtain a wide variety of information.  Marketing-information managers can conduct extensive research on the Internet and obtain lengthy reports and documents rather than brief information.

Causal.  Causal research is marketing research that focuses on cause and effect and tests "what if" theories.  Many of today's hotels use computers to carry out their causal research because the computer can analyze large quantities of data quickly and reach a conclusion.  Exploratory research collects information to help the hotel define its situation, problem, or concern and decide which direction to go in order to address it.  Pre-dictive research is used to help the hotel forecast future business developments.  Descriptive research gathers specific information related to the identified situation, problem, or concern.

Properly interpreted.  Researchers often include tables and charts in the main part of marketing reports in order to graphically depict various statistics that may be difficult to understand.  However, the tables and charts are not useful or effective unless the information they present is properly interpreted.  For example, including pie charts and bar graphs of percentages, tabulations, and ratios is pointless unless there is an accompanying explanation.  Tables and charts are graphically portrayed in marketing reports, but that is not what makes them useful and effective.  They are intended to be visually appealing.  However, they still must be properly inter-preted.  Tables and charts do not need to be computer generated in order to be useful and effective.

  	Identify a target market.  Many hotels maintain guest-history records from information guests provide on their registration cards.  When these records are kept up-to-date, the hotel has an accurate profile of its target market to whom it can send promotional materials.

 	Having an inaccurate idea of future sales is better than having no data at all.  The information provided by forecasting can be used by planners to make decisions that will contribute to the motel's success.  Many marketers consider the sales forecast so important that it is viewed as the cornerstone of their planning.  Therefore, although no sales forecast can be 100% accurate, having an inaccurate idea of what future sales will be is better than having no data at all with which to plan.  If a motel does not have past sales records, it can often obtain information from other sources.  There are many sources of information for sales forecast-ing, even for fairly new products.

Many hotels encourage employees to adopt a friendly, helpful attitude toward customers as part of their efforts to create positive relations.  Being reserved could prevent employees from offering appropriate help and might be interpreted as coldness.  Being talkative may offend customers or prevent employees from identifying their needs.  Being authoritative is only appropriate when providing the customer with technical or factual information.

Concierge.  The concierge is a member of the front-office staff of a full-service hotel and is responsible for a variety of guest services including arranging courtesy transportation to nearby locations.  Most full-service hotels have vans or limousines and provide courtesy transportation to customers, although these hotels usually do not have a transportation department.  Therefore, the concierge handles this service and arranges for guests to be driven to restaurants, theaters, museums, airports, etc.  A bellperson usually handles luggage and escorts guests to their rooms.  A doorman greets guests upon arrival and often arranges taxi service.  The manager is responsible for the overall operation of the hotel rather than arranging courtesy transportation.

How long negotiation will take is seldom determined ahead of time.  Although it may be nice to know, the number of people attending is not a crucial factor in negotiations.  The task at hand is the negotiation.  It is unwise to divide your focus between the negotiation and implementing the outcome.

Property is booked.  At times, hotels are completely booked and unable to accommodate additional guests.  When this situation occurs, a front desk clerk should refer a potential guest to another comparable facility within the area.  Often, the front desk clerk will offer to call another facility to locate a room and have the room held for the guest.  A front desk clerk will sell all available rooms, regardless of the staffing situation, before referring guests to another facility.  If rooms are available, a front desk clerk will sell a room to a guest who does not have a reservation or who arrives late.

Performance.  It is ethical to evaluate employees only on the basis of their performance on the job.  How the employees perform at work is what is important.  Motel managers should not consider factors that have nothing to do with an employee's job performance.  Consequently, it would be unethical for a manager to take into consideration that an employee is also a friend.  An employee's appearance is not a factor unless the appearance and personality somehow impact the employee's performance on the job.

Employees choose an eight-hour period from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  Hotel gift shops that offer flextime allow their employees to choose an eight-hour period during regularly scheduled hours.  Some employees might decide to begin work at 7:00 a.m. in order to leave at 4:00 p.m., while others might prefer to start at 9:00 a.m. and stay until 6:00 p.m.  The advantage of flextime is that employees have the freedom to set their schedules to meet their needs.  Shops also benefit because all employees are present during the main hours of the workday.  Two employees each working four hours of an eight-hour day is an example of job sharing.  Employees working four 10-hour days is an example of a compressed workweek.  Full-time employees often work 40 hours a week.

Room status discrepancies.  Room status discrepancies exist when the front desk does not have up-to-date information about rooms.  For example, if housekeeping delays notifying the front desk that a room is ready for occupancy, the front desk personnel may turn away a walk-in guest or delay a registering guest unneces-sarily.  A delay in communication could decrease sales since the front desk would not know exactly how many rooms are available.  An overage refers to a cash register imbalance.  A lock-out is a room from which the guest is barred until a problem has been corrected.

Role-playing.  Role-playing is the process of assuming roles and acting through a given situation.  It is used in many different kinds of employee training programs.  Case studies are an instructional method that involves giving trainees a written description of an organizational problem, and the trainees are asked to determine the problem and potential solutions.  Brainstorming is a creative thinking technique involving the identification of as many different ideas as possible during a certain time frame.  It can be done by one person but is used most often in a group setting.  Programmed instruction is a training method that presents material in small units that are followed by examinations to determine trainee's knowledge gain.

Contract B by $60.  Service contracts often provide hotels the option of including a certain number of service calls in the yearly price or paying a flat rate for service and then an additional fee for each call.  Depending on the type of service that a hotel needs, it might be more cost-effective to pay for each call if the hotel does not expect to need many repairs.  To calculate the yearly cost of contract B if the hotel needs 12 calls, first multiply the price per call by 12 ($70 x 12 = $840).  Then, add that amount to the base price ($840 + $600 = $1,440).  Subtract the cost of contract B from the cost of contract A to determine the savings ($1,500 – $1,440 = $60).  The hotel will save even more if it does not need 12 calls a year.

45%.  Debt ratio determines the percentage of debt in relationship to assets.  To calculate debt ratio, divide total debt by total assets ($360,000 ÷ $800,000 = .45 or 45%).  Therefore, the amount of the motel's debt is equal to 45% of its total assets.

To identify business purpose.  One of the reasons why hotel managers develop objectives is to identify the purpose of the business.  Determining what a business is and intends to do is the basis for all other company decisions.

Managers do not develop company objectives in order to forecast sales potential, communicate with employees, or solve operating problems.

One night at an all-inclusive resort.  Price in the hospitality industry is the amount that guests pay for the pri-mary services provided by a property.  In most situations, the price is the amount guests pay for one night's lodging.  However, in the case of an all-inclusive resort, price is the amount a guest pays for one night's lodging which also includes a variety of extras such as meals and beverages.  An all-inclusive price is often appealing to guests because they think they are getting a bargain.  Price in the hospitality industry usually does not include dinner in the main dining room, transportation, or sightseeing trips.  These services are often included in a total vacation package which might be provided by the travel and tourism industry.

Operating expenses.  Operating expenses are the costs of running a golf resort, which include fixed expenses (costs that do not change with sales volume) and variable expenses (costs that change in direct relation to sales volume).  A resort's selling prices are also affected by the costs of the product and the amount of profit the resort wants to obtain.  Disposable income is the amount of income people have left to spend, or dispose of, after they have paid their taxes.  Social trends are the directions of changes in people's lifestyles.  Product substitution is suggesting a room other than the original request when the resort does not have the room requested or when the front desk clerk recognizes the customer's true need.  None of these alternatives has a direct effect on selling price.

Competition‑based.  This technique considers the prices that competitors are charging.  This is an important consideration if the hospitality products are closely related.

Profit based is not a pricing method.

Break‑even point.  After a motel reaches the break-even point, it begins to earn a profit because it has recovered its costs.  If sales do not reach this point, the motel will lose money and may fail.  The point of no return is the time at which it is too late to go back, and the individual or business must go forward.  Point-sales quota is a type of sales-volume quota in which salespeople receive a number of points for each dollar or product sold.  Equilibrium point is reached when sellers offer the quantity and prices that are equal to those demanded by buyers.

$875.  Some businesses adjust their base prices based on time considerations such as seasons of the year.  For example, resorts might be able to charge more during the summer than other times of the year because there is more demand during the summer.  This is a type of segmented pricing based on time.  In this exam-ple, the resort charges more in the summer and less during the other seasons.  To calculate the price a guest will pay, first determine the price for the three nights in the fall and the two nights in the winter ($195 x 3 = $585; $145 x 2 = $290).  Then, add the prices for the two seasons ($585 + $290 = $875).

To compete.  Product/Service management helps hospitality marketers to compete effectively.  So many new goods/services are being introduced all the time that competition is fierce in many areas.  Effective product/ service management helps businesses to be prepared for new goods and services that competitors may develop.  It also helps businesses to develop new goods and services of their own in order to stay ahead of competitors.  Recruiting is the process of finding workers for a business.  Prospecting is the process of iden-tifying and locating potential clients.  Bartering is trading or exchanging one item for another.

Encourages repeat visits to the property.  When guests have positive impressions about the cleanliness of the property and the friendliness of the housekeeping staff, they are more likely to come back at a later date.  Properties never want to see their vacancy rate increase, because they rely on profits to stay in business, and empty rooms mean less profit.  The cleanliness of a property really has nothing to do with its financial stability.  A budget hotel on the verge of bankruptcy can pick up litter and wipe off fingerprints just as well as a resort hotel with an endless supply of cash.  There is really no way to tell if the property enforces regular housekeeping inspections without asking.

Competitive advantage.  Suite hotels often gain a competitive advantage over competitors by offering cus-tomers a value or benefit that their competitors do not provide.  If a hotel offers the best quality and service at a reasonable price, it has a competitive advantage over competitors that provide lower quality or higher prices.  When hotels position themselves as providers of quality and service, customers often think of them in those terms and prefer to buy from those hotels.  Hotels do not gain promotional consideration, geographic benefits, or marketing incentives by positioning themselves as the ones offering the best quality and service for the price.

Physical condition of the building exterior and the landscaping.  A property analysis is a self-evaluation that measures strengths, weaknesses, advantages, and disadvantages of the physical property.  Areas that are examined include the exterior of the building, landscaping, and the condition of the signs.  In a property analysis, each interior room is inspected, visual appeal is reviewed, and traffic flow and layout are examined.  To conduct a realistic and productive analysis, the hotel personnel must see the property and its elements through the eyes of the hotel guests.  Evaluating types of group bookings by competitors is part of a competi-tion analysis.  Changes in environmental and demographic elements are considered when conducting a mar-ketplace analysis.  An occupancy and activity analysis reviews the hotel occupancy rates and sales activity.

$163,323.37.  Hotel chains often have many decisions to make when buying advertisements in magazines because of the various options that add cost to the ad.  Magazines usually have set rates for one-page, four-color ads; but a chain will pay extra if it wants the ad to bleed or for the ad to appear on one of the cover pages.  Magazines also offer a variety of discounts including cash discounts if the chain pays right away for the ad.  To calculate the final price of the $134,310 ad, first calculate the bleed charges by multiplying the price by 15% ($134,310 x 15% or .15 = $20,146.50).  Add the bleed charges to the base price as well as the charge for placement on the second cover ($134,310.00 + $20,146.50 + $12,200.00 = $166,656.50).  Calcu-late the cash discount by multiplying the total price by 2% ($166,656.50 x 2% or .02 = $3,333.13).  Subtract the discount to determine the price of the ad ($166,656.50 – $3,333.13 = $163,323.37).

To encourage guests to buy.  Most resorts offer a wide variety of activities and events, and many of these involve an additional cost to the guests.  To encourage guests to buy, resorts post information about these events and activities in locations that are frequented by guests such as lobbies and dining areas.  For example, a poster describing a scheduled hay ride that is available for a modest fee might encourage guests to sign up.  By posting the information, the resort encourages guests to participate and also increases sales.  Resorts post information in the hope of attracting the number of guests that the event or activity can accom-modate.  Resorts do not post information to fill meeting space.  Resorts develop events and activities that will appeal to the target market.

Convenient parking provides a favorable impression of the property because guests can get to and from their rooms easier, but a good night's sleep is far more important.

Multiple decision makers.  In many hospitality businesses, there are several people who are responsible for making buying decisions.  These people often have different opinions about what the company should buy or from whom they should buy.  Frequently, a few people are responsible for gathering information and then a group meets to discuss the choices.  The group must reach a consensus which may mean that it takes a long time for the final buying decision to be made.  Day-to-day activities, local reference groups, and social class structures do not affect organizational buying behavior.

Benefits.  Benefits are advantages that a good or service can provide for the customer.  People buy benefits, not features.  Facts are proven data.  A customer's interest should be gained when product benefits are pre-sented.  Features are physical characteristics or qualities that may be used to describe a product.

Ask for the booking.  Clients usually give clues when they are interested in a particular resort package and almost ready to buy.  These clues might include words such as, "That resort sounds perfect," or "That's a great price."  Body language such as nodding in agreement also indicates interest.  When clients give these clues, it is a good time for the travel agent to ask for the booking.  Clients usually raise objections before they reach the stage of being ready to buy.  When clients indicate an interest in buying, travel agents should try to close the sale rather than continue the presentation.  Travel agents prepare the approach before beginning the sales presentation.

Always be closing.  Since the best time to close the sale may come at any time during the presentation, you must always be alert for these opportunities.  You should avoid negative closes, trying to oversell, and leaving the customer in a state of indecision.

Room availability.  One of the jobs of a front desk clerk is to determine the availability of rooms when checking in guests.  Guests frequently request certain types of rooms, and the front desk clerk must know if that room is currently available.  Front desk clerks keep in contact with housekeeping in order to learn the status of every room in the hotel.  Front desk clerks have information about transportation schedules and dining arrange-ments, but that is not part of the checking-in process.  Front desk clerks do not obtain personal information from guests.

In‑room questionnaires.  Many hotels use in‑room questionnaires to determine how satisfied guests are with the services the property provides.  In‑room questionnaires are often placed on desks or bureaus where they are easy for guests to see.  The questionnaires usually contain a few specific questions about service that guests answer by rating their level of satisfaction.  For example, one question may ask guests to rate the con-dition of their room.  Hotels use this follow‑up information to improve existing services or add new ones that guests indicate they want.  Registration cards, promotional brochures, and direct‑mail newsletters are not used to obtain follow‑up information.

They may need to replace lost customers.  Prospecting enables hotel supply salespeople to replace customers lost through attrition.  While the firm's expectations may include prospecting, that is not a primary reason for prospecting.  Salespeople should prospect in order to gain job security and earn commissions.  Failing to pros-pect may not cause immediate problems but will probably be harmful over time.  Prospecting is not necessarily an enjoyable selling task.

70%.  The number of rooms that are out-of-order (OOO) do not affect the occupancy rate.  In a 250-room hotel, all the rooms are considered available for sale even if they are out-of-order.  To calculate the occupancy rate, divide the number of rooms sold by the total number available (175 ÷ 250 = .70 or 70%).  If rooms are listed as out-of-inventory (OOI), then they have an effect on the occupancy calculation.

Recruit qualified staff.  One of the main responsibilities of a convention hotel sales manager is to recruit, select, and hire qualified individuals who will be the most effective salespeople for the hotel.  Having the right people on staff is the best way to sell the hotel's services.  Qualified salespeople often are able to sell, even under difficult situations.  Sales managers usually are not responsible for making sales calls, prospecting for clientele, or scheduling demonstrations.
