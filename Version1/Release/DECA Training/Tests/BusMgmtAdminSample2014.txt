Recycling programs. Environmental regulations set pollution standards that businesses must meet,
establish rules for disposing of waste, encourage recycling, and monitor illegal dumping. The goal is to
protect the environment. By encouraging businesses to participate in recycling programs, environmental
regulations help to conserve natural resources and control waste. Agencies that oversee environmental
regulations are the ones that enforce the laws. Environmental regulations do not encourage businesses
to participate in resource identification or ethical contracts.

Open corporation. Open corporations sell stock to the general public. By buying stock in an open
corporation, John can become a business owner without daily involvement in the business. In addition,
shareholders in an open corporation are only liable for the amount they invest in the company. Sole
proprietorship is a form of ownership that requires owner participation. General partnership combines the
capital, experience, and abilities of two or more people. Sole proprietorships and general partnerships
involve unlimited liability. A close (private) corporation does not offer stock for sale to the general public.
In many cases, the shareholders manage and operate the business, which means the owners participate
in the day-to-day activities of the business.

Melinda meets with her manager to discuss a possible promotion. A discussion between an employee
and a supervisor about work related issues is formal communication. Formal communication in the
workplace involves behaving professionally and using a respectful tone. Asking another person
(coworker) for an opinion or brochure are informal forms of workplace communication. A possible firing in
the workplace is an example of gossip, which is a type of informal communication that should be avoided.

Organize his notes in a logical manner. Effective note-taking is essential in school as well as on the job.
Regardless of whether you are in a university lecture hall or in a staff meeting, taking notes helps you to
better remember important information and record facts, figures, and other details that may not be
available elsewhere. Notes that are organized in a logical manner are much clearer, more
understandable, and easier to read than notes that follow no form at all. When taking notes, it is not
necessary to capture every word that is said. Instead, you should focus on the main points and subpoints
of the conversation. It is also not necessary to write notes in complete sentences. To save time and
space, you should use abbreviations and symbols whenever appropriate.

Logical arguments. An analytical report is a document that explains and evaluates an issue, opportunity,
or problem. When developing an analytical report that addresses a controversial issue or contains
information that readers might disagree with, the writer should provide logical arguments that explain and
support their conclusions. By providing logical arguments, the writer is more likely to persuade readers to
accept the conclusions. Technical statistics may distract the reader. Personal opinions should not be
expressed during an analytical report. Enthusiastic statements that do not provide logical arguments or
supporting evidence are less likely to convince readers that the conclusions are reasonable.

Recommendations. A research report is a written document that summarizes an investigation related to a
particular issue or problem. The recommendations section is the proposed course of action, and it is the
last component presented in the report. The purpose of the study, which appears at the beginning of the
report, describes why the research is needed. The background or historical information is presented at
the beginning of the report and usually appears after the purpose of the study. The methodology section
of the report appears in the middle of the report and discusses the types of research tools used and why
they were selected.

Resolve problems. Providing good service includes resolving problems and complaints. Some customers

upset as the customer. Solving problems satisfies customers and gives them the service they deserve.
Employees do not have the authority to lower prices, offer discounts, or plan events without the approval
of management.

preferences of management should not be a consideration. Employees who lack good communication
skills can receive training that will improve their skills in communicating policies to customers.

Complaints can often be opportunities. Salespeople should view customers' complaints as opportunities
to impress customers positively. Customers whose complaints are handled satisfactorily often become
repeat customers. This benefits the business and the salesperson. Most businesses expect salespeople
to handle routine complaints as part of their selling responsibilities. Management often provides
assistance if the problem is difficult to resolve. There is no way to prevent all customer complaints.
Complaints can cause problems for both the salesperson and the business if they result in lost sales,
income, and profits.

Authority. The organizational structure is the way the business is set up (designed) to carry out its work.
Many factors influence the way that the business carries out its work—the way it functions. The ways in
which the employees relate to or communicate with one another (interpersonal relationships) and the
type of work (tasks) that needs to be done affect the organizational structure. Authority, which also
influences the organizational structure, is the power a person has to influence or control other people's
behavior. Some organizational structures have centralized authority in which one person or a few people
make business decisions. Other businesses have decentralized authority, a situation in which employees
have the authority to make decisions and hold a high degree of control over their work. An injunction is a
court order forbidding an action. Initiative is a personal trait that involves a willingness to act without
being told to do so. Attrition is the natural reduction in numbers of employees due to job changes, death,

goods and services, rising unemployment, increased saving by consumers, and reduced sales and
profits for businesses. The business is presently in the peak phase of the business cycle which is
considered the high point of economic activity. During this phase, demand for goods and services begins
to exceed the production capacities of producers. Expansion is the first stage of the business cycle,
characterized by increased spending and borrowing, increased demand for goods and services,
increased employment rates, and decreased interest rates or loans. Trough is the fourth phase of the

A European client greets the person with a kiss on each cheek. The concept of space and proximity
differs among cultures. In countries such as the United States and Japan, people prefer to maintain
distance from others during conversation. In these countries, maintaining space is a sign of respect for
the other person. Kissing someone on the cheek requires close proximity, so the American

Both men and woman are expected to wear modest clothing in public. When businesspeople visit a
foreign country, they should try to learn about the culture so that they don't do something offensive.
Before going to a foreign country, businesspeople should research the country's standards for
appearance and dress. For example, wearing shorts or tank tops in Middle Eastern country is exhibiting
an inappropriate appearance. Middle Eastern businesspeople would not take foreigners seriously and
would be quite offended if they walked around in shorts and tank tops. Other aspects of the culture that
foreign businesspeople may want to research include nonverbal behavior such as facial expressions and
gestures and communication styles. Because government and religion are closely connected in many

for your actions. In the example, Tim admits that he made a mistake by not conducting computer backup
activities, so he is accepting the responsibility for his behavior. When you blame others for your actions,
you are not accepting responsibility for your behavior. Taking responsibility for your actions often involves
admitting and learning from your mistakes and trying to do better in the future, rather than promising not
to make any more mistakes. It does not always involve making informed decisions because some people
make decisions without knowing all the facts, or they make impulsive decisions.

whatever they write can be accessed and read by others. With this in mind, employees should avoid

person does not have the money to purchase a desired item. When a person purchases something that
s/he doesn't need but really wants, the benefit to the person is immediate gratification or a sense of
instant satisfaction that s/he has acquired the desired product. The opportunity cost (benefit lost) is not a
higher discretionary income, lower salary or wages, or long-term dissatisfaction.

Pay off your balance each month. If you must use credit cards, the most effective way to avoid excessive
credit-card debt is to pay off your balance each month. By paying back what you've borrowed each
month, you can avoid paying interest and other costly fees. If you cannot pay off your balance each
month, work to pay off high-interest credit cards first, since high-interest credit cards cost you more in the
long run than low-interest cards. Choose credit cards with low limits so that you have less of an
opportunity to accumulate debt. Credit-card cash advances usually result in extremely high interest
charges, often 20% or more. So, it is wise to avoid cash advances, rather than using them to pay debt.

its employees for their work on a regular basis throughout the year. Mortgage loans are long-term
liabilities because businesses usually make mortgage payments for several years. Accounts receivable
are assets because they are all the monies owed to the business by its customers. Owner's equity is the

Inevitable disclosure. The concept of inevitable disclosure suggests that workers are likely to intentionally

disclosure because these types of agreements inhibit a worker's right to seek employment. These
jurisdictions view the sharing of knowledge as an inevitable occurrence, which may occur unintentionally.

results that a business might want to achieve is a gain in market share, which is a business's portion of

lower the price of a product for the purpose of taking business away from competitors. If the price is
lower, the business has an opportunity to gain market share. If the price is significantly lower, the
business might lose money in the short-term, while increasing market share. Lowering the price of a

Nolo Legal Encyclopedia. Expertise and credibility are primary considerations when evaluating the
relevance of a source. Because regulations and legal procedures are important considerations when
setting up a corporation, Melissa should obtain information from a source that has legal expertise, such
as Nolo Legal Encyclopedia (www.nolo.com). The Wall Street Journal is a print and online business
publication that focuses on a wide variety of business and economic issues and trends. Because
Wikipedia is an open source of information that is constantly updated, some of the information might be
inaccurate or irrelevant. MarketWatch is a website that focuses on financial issues such as investing and

To be ethical. Businesses gather and maintain a wide range of information, and some of this information
may be private or confidential. For example, businesses may have personal information about customers
and employees. Making sure that this information is secure is a matter of ethics. Businesses have an
ethical obligation to protect certain information so it does not become public and cause harm to
individuals. Businesses do not keep information secure to be secretive, beat the competition, or avoid
publicity.

To graph data. Spreadsheet software enables businesses to perform accounting and other mathematical
functions. A user can enter numerical information in rows and columns, and the software will perform
various calculations or analyses. Another standard capability of spreadsheet software is to convert this
data into graph form. Complicated accounting information is often easier to understand when it is
presented visually in the form of graphs or charts. Presentation software is used to create slides. Wordprocessing
software is used to prepare text. Database software is used to manage files.

Allocate project resources. Project-management software allows businesses to plan, track, and evaluate

Stakeholders, rather than software, define the project's purpose, establish the project's standards, and
evaluate the quality of project deliverables.

Forecast sales. An invoice is the formal, printed record of a sale that includes all necessary information
as to the buyer, the seller, items purchased, amounts, prices, delivery date, credit or discount terms, etc.
By analyzing past sales records such as invoices, a business can determine what its customers are
buying, when they are buying, and how much they are buying. This helps a business forecast future
sales so it can be prepared to offer the products that customers want. Businesses do not review their
invoices to evaluate ideas, execute promotions, or improve service.

Inventory records. Inventory records contain information related to the goods that a business has on
hand or on order. They are also likely to contain information about a retail business's suppliers and the
products that the business purchases from each to sell to consumers. Quality records usually contain
information regarding the degree of excellence of the business's products. Human-resources records
contain information about the business's employees. Payroll records contain information about money
paid to employees in a given period.

Statistical findings. Statistics are information presented in numerical form. For the statistics to be useful,
businesses must analyze and interpret them. For example, it may be important for businesses to find out
how many customers are in certain age groups, and then convert those figures to percentages to
determine which groups make the most purchases. By analyzing this type of statistical finding,
businesses can make decisions about targeting certain groups to increase sales and profits. Businesses
might analyze training results rather than training methods. They do not analyze information skills or
privacy factors when making business decisions to improve the company.

Local ordinances. Businesses must follow various government regulations that are designed to protect
the public from illness and hazardous conditions. To ensure that businesses are following these
regulations, government agencies at all levels often inspect businesses. For example, the local fire
department may inspect a business facility to determine if the business has the appropriate number of
fire extinguishers as required by law. If an inspection determines that a business is violating regulations,
the agency may fine the business or close it until the business is in compliance. Free-trade agreements,
securities regulations, and consumer-protection laws do not involve inspecting facilities to determine if
the business is free of safety and health hazards.

tool, and/or machinery. Even Steve, who recently purchased a used laptop for work, must follow the
manufacturer's instructions—usually found in a user's manual—for the computer. Since Steve doesn't
currently have the laptop user's manual, he can't be sure that he is using it properly. He is most likely to
find a copy of the manual on the Internet because most manufacturers (of computers, kitchen appliances,
automobiles, etc.) post all of their owner's manuals on their websites for users to download for free. He is
much less likely to find a copy of the manual at the library, a used-book store, or even an office-supply
store. Although many office-supply stores sell computers, they may not sell that particular model. If they
do not, they are unlikely to have the manual on hand.

one part of a project may need to be completed before another part can begin. Project managers make

Internal audit. An audit is an evaluation of an organization, process, or project. The project manager and
team members can determine its successes, strengths, problems, and weaknesses by evaluating all
aspects of the project upon completion. The evaluation helps the project team develop a “lessons
learned” document that can be used by teams that execute similar projects for the organization in the
future. A comprehensive audit will evaluate many different activities associated with the project, including
resource utilization, team productivity and performance, efficiency of processes, and stakeholders'
satisfaction, which is done by comparing the objectives with the actual results.

Control the project. Controlling is the management function of monitoring the work effort. Various reports
can help project managers monitor the work effort. An activity-status report provides a project manager
with information about where the project stands at a given point. If the activity-status report indicates that
the project is running behind, then the project manager can takes steps to get the project back on track.
Reviewing an activity-status report does not create barriers but may identify them. The project manager
determines the project scope and develops project specifications during the project planning phase,
rather than the project execution phase.

Ongoing cooperation. When a business is continuously willing to work with other businesses (e.g.,

These actions help build a trusting and favorable relationship. In most situations, a company does not
need to fully disclose all of its business information to its vendors—only relevant information.

Special. A special order is a request for a custom product or a product that a vendor does not normally
carry in stock. Because the Frederick Company needs a shelving unit that has unusual measurements,
the vendor needs to custom make it for the company. An open order is an order for staple goods that is
placed with one of several available vendors who can meet the business's immediate requirements (e.g.,
time, price, quantity). A blanket order is an order that covers all or part of a retailer's seasonal
requirements. A reorder is an order for items that the business has previously purchased. There is not
enough information provided to determine if the Frederick Company has previously ordered the same
custom-made shelves.

Buffer. A business carries buffer inventory when the supply of and demand for goods are uncertain. If the
demand goes up, and supply goes down, having buffer inventory helps the business to cover its needs
until supply is stable and available. Maintenance inventory refers to items the business uses to maintain
the facility such as cleaning supplies and light bulbs. Perpetual inventory is a record of inventory
information that is continuously updated. Customary inventory is sometimes used to describe the
regularly stocked goods that the business carries.

Concede on minor points before major points. Planning for concessions is an important aspect of an
effective negotiation strategy. A concession is something that one party gives up during a negotiation. In
many situations, one party will give up something that it wants and use it (the concession) as leverage to
get something else that it wants later during the negotiation process. An effective negotiator wants to give
up (concede) something minor or unimportant early to make it seem more valuable than it really is. If the
negotiator gives up a major point early in the negotiation, then s/he will lose her/his power base and
leverage. If the negotiator does not plan to provide some concessions, then the negotiation session may
end in a stalemate, and agreement may not be reached. Refusing to concede anything might result in a
stalemate.

Fair treatment. Discrimination is the unfair treatment of a person or a group based on the person's or

treating people fairly on the basis of their gender. In many countries, there are laws that prohibit
discrimination, so businesses should take steps to ensure that they are in compliance with the law and
treating their employees fairly. The example does not describe the employees' right to work in a safe
environment or their right to privacy. Businesses do not prevent employees from buying stock. Some
types of corporations encourage their employees to buy their company stock.

Insurance company did not explain all of the policy's exclusions to the store. It is unethical for an

should explain important information so the policyholder understands what the policy covers. The
policyholder can reduce or manage its risk by reviewing (or having a lawyer review) the contract carefully
before signing it. The insurance company can reduce the risk of policyholders filing lawsuits by explaining
the policy's terms clearly. If the store owner did not pay the insurance premium on time, the policy
lapsed, and the insurance company is not obligated to pay for damages. When the insurance policy was

businesses control security risks is by installing firewalls on computer networks to prevent computer
hackers from obtaining confidential financial data (e.g., customers' credit-card numbers). Another way
that businesses control security risk is by limiting employees' access to certain financial information,
which often involves the use of passwords and security codes. Purchasing is the function of acquiring

preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. Compliance with the law is an important aspect of
risk management. If a business does not comply with laws, the government may fine the business, which
could result in substantial financial losses. A substantial financial loss can hinder the business's ability to
achieve its goals. Increased inventory and decreased quotas are not risks that are directly associated
with failure to comply with laws.

involves long-term planning (more than one year) and focuses on the general future of company.

Actual results. Control is the management function that involves comparing what was planned with the
actual results. To be successful, businesses must be able to achieve what they plan. By monitoring the
actual results, managers will know if the business is performing as planned or if changes need to be
made. Goals are the objectives the business plans to achieve. Managerial control does not involve
comparing what was planned with the operating policies or the established strategies.
