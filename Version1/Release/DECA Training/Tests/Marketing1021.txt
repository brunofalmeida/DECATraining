in a fair manner. Businesses are often involved in disputes with other entities, such as suppliers or
competitors. If a business believes it has been wronged by another, the business follows the appropriate

not the main functions of the legal procedure.

Horizontal. Horizontal conflict occurs between businesses at the same level in the distribution channel.
Branch locations of a business that operate in the same community are on the same level. The branches
may experience horizontal channel conflict because they are targeting, and competing for, the same
customers. Vertical conflict occurs between different levels of the same channel, such as between the
local branch and the corporate office. Community and dominant are not types of channel conflict.

solve. Information flow is the process of moving information through the appropriate channels or making
information accessible to those who need it. A situation analysis is a determination of a firm's current
business situation and the direction in which the business is headed. Marketing research gathers primary
data rather than secondary data information collected for purposes other than the project at hand.

Few friends talking about football. If the group's purpose is to give and find out opinions, the way the
group operates is casual. No real “rules” exist beyond the normal standards of common courtesy. When
the football players toss the football or run laps during practice, they are likely to operate under the
direction of the coach. In a similar way, selecting a strategy or play may require the football players to
conduct a more formal group discussion.

Credibility. The purpose of a persuasive message is to convey information that encourages the reader to
take a specific course of action. Credibility is believability. A believable source demonstrates knowledge
in a confident, trustworthy, and responsible manner. People are more likely to take action when they feel
that the source is credible. Message receivers do not tend to take action if the source exhibits
inconsistent behavior. A message receiver will first consider the source's credibility before it considers
the source's adaptability. Objectivity is viewing things in an unbiased manner. Since the message sender
is trying to get the message receiver to take a certain course of action, the message receiver has a
specific opinion. Therefore, the message sender may exhibit some bias about the topic at hand.

Their immediate supervisor. Problems related to work should be discussed with the employee's
immediate supervisor because this person should be the first to be told that a problem exists, and s/he
should be given an opportunity to resolve it. The personnel department deals with problems connected to
the hiring or firing of employees. Discussing problems with coworkers is often done but is not
recommended. It is not part of the company president's job to deal with individual problems unless they
cannot be solved by a subordinate.

Use customer names in conversations. Customers enjoy hearing their names, and they feel important
when they realize employees have taken the time to learn them. You should maintain eye contact, not
stare. You should speak at a comfortable volume—not too loudly or too softly. You should try, whenever
possible, to resolve customers' problems without involving a supervisor.

Employee. Businesses have policies that explain how employees are to act and how they are to deal with
customers. Some of these policies include rules about eating and smoking on the job. Businesses make
these policies to present a certain image to customers. Service policies are established to provide special
features that other, similar businesses may not offer in order to persuade customers to choose their
business over another. Some policies affect customers directly, such as guidelines for offering credit. A
product policy is a guideline affecting the kinds of goods and services that businesses offer to customers.

Show a large selection of products. Slow/Methodical, or analytical, customers require a lot of time in
making buying decisions. They want to know everything about a product so that they make the best
decision. In addition, they do not buy immediately. They want time to think about and research the
product. Therefore, you should avoid showing them too many products, as this will only compound their
problem in reaching buying decisions. The other alternatives are guidelines for helping slow/methodical,
or analytical, customers.

Possession. Possession utility is created when the ownership of a product is transferred from the seller to
the customer. Credit plans allow customers to pay for their purchases gradually, thereby increasing their
ability to own (possess) more products. Place utility involves making goods and services available at the
place (location) they are wanted or needed by customers. Form utility occurs when the shape or form of a
product is altered to make it more useful to the customer. Price is a component of the marketing mix but
is not a type of economic utility.

Matrix. Businesses can structure the way they do their work in a variety of ways. The matrix
organizational structure uses horizontal authority to integrate departmental functions with product
orientation. For example, an engineer, a marketing specialist, a financial coordinator, and a
manufacturing employee are members of different departments but often work together to develop or
refine one product. The advantage to businesses using this organizational structure is that the business
is applying its resources efficiently because a representative from each of the major departments is
knowledgeable about various aspects of the product. Vertex, regional, and regulated are not terms that
describe types of business organizational structures.

Oligopoly. An oligopoly is a market structure in which there are relatively few sellers, and industry leaders
usually determine the prices. Because an oligopoly has interdependent multiple sellers, product prices
are usually stable. A monopoly is a condition in which a market is controlled by one supplier or single
seller, and there are no substitute goods or services readily available. A technical monopoly is a type of
monopoly in which the seller controls the market with one or more technical products. Differentiated
oligopoly is a fictitious term.

It's easier to train workers. For example, it is easier to train workers to specialize in sewing on shirt
collars than to train them to perform all the tasks necessary to sew, iron, and package the finished shirts.

workers. Management uses job rotation to overcome some of the disadvantages of specialization.

Peak. Peak is the phase of the business cycle when economic prosperity reaches a high point, and the
demand for goods and services begins to exceed the production capacities of producers. Expansion is

Subcultures. A subculture is a group with distinguishing characteristics that exists within a culture. The
customs, habits, and traditions of businesspeople are considered to be a business subculture. The
businesspeople in different countries have different business subcultures, which means that the
businesspeople from one country share certain beliefs, values, and ideals that are different from those of
people in other countries. The way they behave in business is based on those beliefs and values.
Therefore, in order to trade successfully throughout the world, businesspeople need to understand what
is acceptable business behavior in other countries. Business policies, activities, and contracts differ from
one business to another and do not have a significant impact on business behavior.

communicating without the use of words. Creativity is the ability to generate unique ideas, goods, or

Build strong, loyal customer relationships. When a business understands what its customers like and
dislike about its goods and services, it can incorporate activities to maintain, improve, or expand its
products. When customers see that the business is showing interest in meeting their needs and wants,
they are more likely to continue the relationship with the business. A business's tax deductions are not
generally based on its ability to track its customers' buying behavior. Operational expenses refer to all of
the expenses (costs) of running the business. A database can facilitate efficient use of a business's

To revise its marketing strategy. Businesses monitor lost-business reports because they usually contain
an explanation of why customers no longer buy from the business. The reports might indicate that
customers are dissatisfied with the product, dissatisfied with the business's credit policies, or are getting
better prices and more service from competitors. A business might use this information to make changes
to its marketing strategy in an attempt to regain customers or to prevent other customers from taking their
business elsewhere. The more information a business obtains from lost-business reports, the better able
it is to make useful and effective marketing decisions. Businesses do not use the information in lostbusiness
reports to change their operating goals, identify their target markets, or update their promotional
techniques.

Each answer has a specific numeric value. Businesses often develop surveys to obtain marketing
information. To process and analyze that information, businesses often develop a code for the answers
to survey questions. Coding is the process of assigning a numeric value to the various responses on a
marketing questionnaire or survey. For example, there are five possible answers to a question, and the
first answer has a numeric value of one. The second answer has a numeric value of two, the third answer
has a numeric value of three, and so on. By using a code, businesses can quickly process the results to
determine which response is selected the most or the least. Coding does not involve numbering
questions in chronological order, or tabulating results according to date received. Although each survey
may contain a unique identification number, that is not an example of coding.

Marketing concept. The marketing concept is based on satisfying the needs and wants of customers. By
reordering a discontinued product, businesses are satisfying their customers' requests. The production
process is the activity of producing goods and services. The promotional mix is the combination of
communication channels a business uses. The promotional-mix concept does not result from providing
previously discontinued products. Distribution involves moving, storing, locating, and/or transferring
ownership of goods and services.

combination of the four elements of marketing. Although risk is involved with every plan of action, the

than in rural areas. Also, the population of many areas is becoming more multicultural, or made up of
many different ethnic groups. Businesses consider demographic trends because they realize that
changes in the population have an effect on how they market their goods and services to customers.
Although where customers live may affect the environment, it's not an environmental trend. Likewise,
where customers live can affect their access to technology; however, it is not a technical trend. Cultural
trends would involve long-term changes to people's values and beliefs. They do not relate to the ages of
people.

Computer-aided design. Computer-aided design is very useful in operations. Designing and testing
products in the virtual world before trying them out in the real world can save companies a lot of time and
money. Using computer software, a company can design, test, and redesign a product many times over
until it's ready for production—all without wasting unnecessary resources. While wireless Internet, e-mail,
and smart phones might also be useful in operations, computer-aided design stands out as the most
useful and specific technology to enhance this business function.

They lift a load that is too heavy, stand too far from the load, or use their back and arms to do the lifting.

Lowers costs. An important benefit of effective purchasing is that it helps businesses to keep their costs
down. A business's purchasing department tries to lower costs by buying quality goods at the lowest
possible price, by buying only the quantity of goods that is needed, and by making sure the goods are
delivered when needed for use or for resale. Effective purchasing does not create jobs, increase assets,

Turns resources into products. Production is the process or activity of producing goods or services
wanted by consumers. Production takes the business's resources (inputs) and turns them into salable
products (outputs). If the products produced make a profit for the business, this could change business
failure to success, but that is not the reason production is called a conversion process. Product utility is
usefulness or the capability of satisfying consumers' needs, which is a desirable result of the production
process.

Arriving at work on time. Employees should arrive on time because the business pays them to work a

daily rotation would increase expenses because of the time it would take. Employees should also help to
control expenses by handling products carefully to prevent damage and by being on the lookout for thefts
by customers or other employees.

To eliminate health hazards. Many products, particularly drug and food products, have expiration dates
printed on their packages. These dates indicate the times after which the products should not be sold or
used. It is important for businesses to routinely discard products whose expiration dates have expired to
avoid using or selling items that are potential health hazards. If these products are spoiled or otherwise
contaminated, the people who buy and use them may experience health problems. Businesses do not
discard expired products to prevent cross-contamination, obtain replacement items, or follow federal
guidelines.

the workplace might include their ability to perform and produce quality work in a given time, willingness
to learn new activities, level of flexibility, and degree of workplace socializing. Self-concept refers to how
one views him/herself. Inner-qualitative and personal-orientation are not terms frequently used to
describe self-control issues as they relate to the workplace.

These businesses frequently are willing to hire the teenagers who are members of their community. Most
employment agencies do not work with people looking for entry-level jobs. Teenagers usually don't find
their first jobs with national corporations unless those corporations have local offices. Community training

To be able to promote from within. Many businesses prefer to promote from within whenever possible
and help current employees move up the career ladder. To do this, businesses often provide
opportunities for their employees to continue their education or receive additional training. As a result,
they have a pool of qualified employees to choose from when higher-level jobs become available. This
benefits the employees because they can advance within the business. Businesses often provide
financial assistance, such as tuition reimbursement, to help employees continue their education.
However, that is not the reason for providing the additional training. Businesses do not provide
educational opportunities to identify problems in the company or to support the local community college.

Easier to change prices. Bar codes that include price information can be scanned into a register terminal
where the price is read and recorded. When a business needs to change a price, such as to offer a sale
price, an employee can enter the change into the scanning system computer, and the change is made for
every item. This is a faster and more economical method than manually changing prices on every item.
Customers will need a scanning device to read the price. There are seldom changes in the number of
security personnel or employees based on the use of bar-code pricing techniques.

considering each idea for a new product and discarding ideas that seem unworkable. A feasibility
analysis is the step in the new-product development process that involves examining such factors as
demand, costs, competition, capital investment required, and potential profit of a product to determine
how it will fit into the company's product mix.

Product/service management. Product/Service management is a marketing function that involves
understanding the concepts and processes needed to obtain, develop, maintain, and improve a product
or service mix in response to market opportunities. An important part of product/service management
involves maintaining and improving the product or service because customers expect a quality product or
service that keeps up with advances in technology. Satellite communications systems make it possible
for businesses to track shipments from the time they are ordered until they are delivered to customers,
thereby improving the product or service. Marketing-information management is a marketing function that
involves understanding the concepts, systems, and tools needed to gather, access, synthesize, evaluate,
and disseminate information for use in making business decisions. Transportation and receiving are
distribution activities. Selling is a marketing function that involves determining client needs and wants,
and responding through planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and
enhances future business opportunities. Promotion is a marketing function that involves communicating
information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome.

It enables consumers to buy without having to inspect each product. The use of grades and standards
speeds up the buying and selling process because consumers can buy without having to inspect each
product. It also furnishes information that salespeople can use to justify price, to sell benefits, and to
meet customer needs. The use of grades and standards enables salespeople to recommend products
that best meet customer needs. Although grades and standards provide product information, they do not
address unsafe products. Unsafe products should not be offered since they are a business liability.
Product prices will vary based on the product's grade. Therefore, the prices will not necessarily be high.

the opportunity to ask questions and receive an immediate answer. Customers often interact with a
business's promotional message by purchasing goods and services online. Specialty and transit are not
examples of interactive mass media. Electronic spectaculars do allow businesses to promote their

Marketers often select their direct advertising methods based on customers' preferences. Customers
often respond to promotional messages for certain products when those messages are transmitted via
direct advertising (e.g., direct mail) rather than other media. For example, research indicates that
customers generally prefer to receive information regarding grocery, health, and beauty products through
direct mail rather than through other venues such as telephone or in retail establishments. Although
direct advertising often rewards businesses with higher response rates than other forms of advertising, it
cannot be assumed that most businesses receive high response rates. Computer messages (e.g., spam)
are often deleted by users before the message is opened, which lowers response rates. Although some
governments have introduced legislation to restrict telemarketing programs, the medium is not
necessarily becoming obsolete. Infomercial and home shopping television shows can be very effective
promotional tools that often experience immediate response from customers.

The nature of the customer. Because of the limited contact with customers, retailers tend to spend little
time prospecting, determining customer needs, and building relationships. This is generally because in
many retail situations, customers already know what they want when they walk into the store. A
manufacturing company generally sells to other businesses. The volume of customers is generally less,
and the representatives need to spend more time qualifying customers and determining their needs.
Since retail businesses and manufacturing companies vary within their own industries in terms of sales
volume, communication levels, and business structures (e.g., corporation, hybrid), these options are not
usually considered primary differences in regard to selling approaches.
