Increase operating costs. Environmental laws are intended to conserve and protect the natural
environment. Many of these laws have an impact on the way businesses operate by requiring them to
decrease pollution or control waste. As a result, businesses often need to spend money to comply with
the rules and regulations, which leads to an increase in operating costs. For example, a business might
need to purchase pollution-control devices. Environmental laws do not require businesses to hire more
employees or develop exterior landscapes. The laws do not limit equipment purchases. In fact,
businesses may need to buy more equipment to comply with the laws.

Corporation. Stockholders in corporations have limited liability; that is, their losses are limited to the
amount of money that they have invested in the business. Partnerships and sole proprietorships have
unlimited liability, meaning that the business owners are personally liable for debts incurred by the
business. Joint proprietorship is not a form of business ownership.

Provide information to investors so they can make informed decisions. Full-disclosure laws and
regulations require companies to disclose—publicize—any information that could affect the value of the
firms' stocks. Investors need this information so they can make informed buy, hold, or sell decisions
about investments. Full-disclosure laws also prevent company employees and other insiders from using
privileged information for their personal gain. Full-disclosure laws do not require companies to disclose
every bit of information about their operations—some undisclosed trade secrets are permitted. Fulldisclosure
laws and regulations are not designed to impact par values of stock.

In compliance. There are various government regulations pertaining to the finance industry that financial
institutions are required to follow. When financial institutions follow the regulations, they are in
compliance with the laws and regulations. Many of these laws affect how financial information is reported,
and how the privacy of personal financial information is protected. When financial institutions follow
government regulations, they are abiding by the law rather than being ethical. Being ethical is voluntary
whereas being in compliance is required by law. The financial institutions are not in mediation or being
independent.

Comparative reasoning. A virtual auditor, which is a type of compliance technology, uses multiple
reasoning processes to continuously review financial transactions and processes to identify errors and/or
compliance violations. Comparative reasoning is used to identify financial system transactions that are
very similar to each other but not exactly alike. For example, after identifying two close matches,
comparative reasoning is used to determine if one transaction was entered multiple times or if the two
entries in the system are for two separate transactions. Contextual reasoning is used to consider each
financial transaction's circumstances and how it compares to historical patterns in the system. Temporal
reasoning involves considering the timing of a financial transaction. Cross-source reasoning is used to
compare financial transactions and processes in multiple financial systems.

Minutes of a staff meeting. Simple written reports are often intended to provide information to the

summary to distribute to all employees. This serves to remind employees of the topics discussed and
provide that information to employees who may have been unable to attend. Results of a research study,
findings of a major investigation, and analysis of a publicity campaign are examples of complex written
reports.

Suggestions. Upward communication involves sending a message to someone at a higher level in the

managers. Instructions, evaluations, and corrections are usually transmitted from a higher level down to

Be honest, open, and trustworthy. While it is important for finance professionals to help their clients
manage their finances and grow their wealth, it is also important that they earn their clients' trust. Finance
professionals earn their clients' trust by behaving ethically and being honest and open. By doing so,
finance professionals are more likely to build long-term relationships with their clients. Finance
professionals must help clients set financial goals with which the clients are comfortable—some clients
can or want to make risky investments, while others take a more conservative approach. Earning trust
and helping clients meet their financial goals also involve ongoing, consistent, and frequent
communication with their clients. Requiring clients to sign a short-term contract will not always help
finance professionals build long-term relationships with their clients.

Fines, penalties, and bankruptcy. When a business does not follow or comply with government
regulations, it may experience negative consequences. The government might issue penalties or high
fines for noncompliance. Noncompliance may result in a poor public image that lowers the business's
credibility with the public. Customers may stop buying from the business and start buying products from
the business's competitors, resulting in lower sales. Lower sales negatively affect the business's financial
health and may cause the business to file for bankruptcy. If the business is a corporation, noncompliance
issues may negatively affect its stock values.

To maintain productivity. Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension.
Excessive stress can have a negative effect on employees, such as reducing productivity. When
employees feel stress, they may not work efficiently. Also, stress may cause employees to miss work
because of stress-related illnesses. To maintain productivity, many businesses develop activities and
programs that help employees reduce stress. For example, some businesses provide recreational
activities such as exercise programs during the work day. Some businesses provide quiet areas for
employees to relax or listen to music. The intention is to reduce stress so employees will remain healthy
and productive. Businesses do not develop programs and activities to help reduce employee stress to
encourage creativity, eliminate conflict, or exhibit empathy.

Issuing notes, bonds, and other obligations. Finance companies, also known as credit companies, are a

obligations. They use this capital to provide loans to businesses and consumers. Insurance companies
raise capital by investing funds from premiums and offering loans to clients. Deposit-taking institutions
accept funds from savers and use those funds to offer loans to borrowers. Investment institutions, not
finance companies, establish mutual funds and investment banks.

Debt instruments. Debt instruments are assets that generate income, usually by charging interest, for the
asset provider. For example, a mortgage is a financial product (asset) provided by a financial institution
(asset provider or lender) to a home or business owner. The borrower pays back the mortgage or loan
with interest. Charging and collecting interest is the way that the financial institution makes money by
providing the loan. Government bonds are debt instruments because the organizations or individuals who
purchase the bonds (asset providers) earn interest (income) on the bond from the bond issuer
(government). An equity instrument involves acquiring ownership of an asset, such as stock. Mortgages
and government bonds are not examples of unrated investments or interest-free services.

To lower costs. Consolidation is the merging of financial providers within the same institutional category.
For example, consolidation occurs when two banks merge to form one bank. By consolidating, the
financial firms can achieve economies of scale, which result in reduced redundancy and lower costs.

can also provide consumers with a wider range of financial products. Consolidation may or may not lower
business risk.

Convergence. Convergence occurs when financial providers from different financial sectors (e.g.,

their companies. Tactical planning is short-range planning (one year) of specific actions the business will
take. Two businesses should look much further ahead than just one year before making the decision to
merge. Licensing is a business structure that requires the authorization or permission from an owner of
another entity to use trademarked, copyrighted, or patented material for a specific activity, during a
specific time period, for the profit of both parties. Businesses that enter into licensing agreements do not
merge.

Stock prices to increase. Falling interest rates typically cause stock prices to increase. When interest
rates fall, it becomes less expensive for companies to acquire funds needed to finance projects and
operations. Because their borrowing costs decrease, the companies' earnings often increase. As a result
of higher earnings, the companies' stock prices increase as well. Falling interest rates usually cause a
positive change in stock prices, not a decrease in stock prices. A stock market crash is a sudden,
dramatic decline in stock prices.

Quickly withdraw their money from the emerging market. When an emerging market suffers an economic
decline, market prices are likely to decline as well. Rather than investing more in the emerging market at
the lowered prices and helping the emerging market to recover, foreign investors are typically selfinterested.
Therefore, they are likely to withdraw their money from the emerging market and invest the
funds in more stable markets elsewhere in the world. The loss of foreign investors' funds often wreaks
even more havoc on the emerging market. An economic decline is not likely to reduce transaction costs
in the emerging market.

overreliance on a master source and system for financial data is not typically a financial-information
management problem. Few companies have a single master source of data nor a single system for
recording and reporting the data. Rather than strict organizational data governance policies and
processes, most companies suffer from inadequate data governance. Due to increased compliance
regulations, most companies have much more financial information than ever before.

in financial statements and performance scorecards, etc. Since use of efficient budgeting applications
decreases the amount of time required to complete the accounting cycle, financial professionals have
time to spend on value-added activities, such as decision-making and presentation of information, rather
than having to spend more time on them. An audit trail and increased ability to trace the numbers used in
budgets are natural outgrowths of the use of budgeting applications.

Financial outcomes. Computer spreadsheet software has the ability to calculate formulas and organize
numerical data. When a business inputs different values or sets of numerical data in a spreadsheet, the
spreadsheet software calculates the values or sets of data, which provides different outcomes based on
the values or sets of data that were used. By reviewing the various outcomes, the business can
determine the best course of action to take under particular circumstances; the “what ifs” of specific
situations. Production strategies are the activities used to produce goods and services. Distribution
methods are the strategies that a business uses to make sure that products are delivered to the right
people at the right place at the right time. Accounting standards are the degrees to which accounting
practices (financial recordkeeping) meet certain criteria.

To evaluate the amount of money associated with inventory storage. To maintain profitability, a firm must
evaluate its costs in relation to its various business functions, which include purchasing, marketing,
human resources, operations, etc. Businesses often analyze the various costs associated with carrying
products. For example, a temperature-sensitive product may require special warehousing
accommodations, which increases the costs associated with storing the product. Businesses use

Queries. Businesses store their financial information in databases. Businesses can retrieve, manipulate,

database. Symbols might be used to set the query, but not always. Tabs are tools used to indent words
and phrases in a word-processing program. Businesses do not set panels to obtain financial data from
databases.

Cash-flow statement. A cash-flow statement is a financial report that contains estimates as to when,

institutions want to look at loan applicants' cash-flow statements to determine if they have enough money
to operate. If an applicant seems to have problems paying bills due to continuous cash shortages, a
lending institution may believe it is too risky to process the loan because the applicant may not be able to
pay back the loan. A corporation charter is a permit granted by the government to a business that allows

Debt ratio. To reduce the risk of nonpayment or default on a loan, a bank reviews the loan applicant's
debt ratio before approving the loan. The debt ratio indicates the applicant's current level of debt in
relation to his/her current assets (e.g., income, home). If the applicant has a high level of outstanding
debt and few liquid assets, the applicant is more likely to default on the loan. In this situation, the
applicant would most likely be denied the loan. The bank may consider the economy's inflation rate in
relation to the applicant's debt ratio when evaluating the loan application. The bank is not likely to
consider the applicant's brand preferences or performance goals.

Each other. An intranet is an internal network of computers within an organization that allows employees

transmit, and share information across departments, divisions, or branches. For example, an intranet
may allow sales staff, purchasing staff, and warehouse staff to view the inventory status of the business's
products simultaneously. This is important because each department works with the business's products
in different ways. The intranet system allows each department to monitor the business's inventory levels
to perform the work. The intranet provides employees access to the same information at any given time,
and helps the business run efficiently. Intranet systems often contain confidential information and are not
shared with competitors, customers, and former employees.

technology reduces the number of employees needed to perform these tasks, which controls costs. Other
computer programs organize and schedule production activities, which decrease costs and increase
productivity. Hiring employees may increase costs and will not necessarily increase productivity. The type

environment. If employees can change policies at anytime, the risk of unethical activity increases. Some
records, such as personnel files and customer financial data, are confidential, and should not be

Controlling their risks. Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling,

complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may be sued or fined, which could
result in substantial financial losses. A failure to comply with laws may also affect the business's
credibility with its customers. If customers feel that the business behaves in a legally negligent manner,
they may believe that the business is untrustworthy and may decide not to buy from the business. A
business that effectively controls its risks is more likely to reduce its liabilities than increase them. A
