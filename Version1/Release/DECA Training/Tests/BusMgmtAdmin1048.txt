Protect the well-being of individuals and businesses. Businesses must follow a variety of government
regulations, such as labor laws, environmental laws, and trade regulations. The purpose of regulating
business activities is to protect consumers and businesses from unethical behavior and to provide a fair
environment in which businesses can compete. In a free-enterprise economic system, regulations
encourage competition rather than limit it. Although governments often implement policies that encourage
business expansion and change international trade initiatives, these are not primary reasons for
regulating business activities.

Master-servant. In legal terms, the master-servant relationship refers to the amount of control that a
principal (e.g., employer or client) has over an agent (e.g., employee or attorney). Determining if a
master-servant relationship exists is an important consideration when addressing a business's legal
issues and disputes, especially in cases that involve liability questions. Factors that determine if a
master-servant relationship exists include the nature of the agent's work, the level of the agent's control
(e.g., decision making), and the agent's level of supervision. Principal-captive, contractor-subordinate,
and arbitrator-civilian are not terms that are widely used to describe agency relationships in law.

Identify the audience. It is important for business employees to identify the audience before preparing an
oral presentation because the type of audience will have an effect on the information that is provided. For
example, if the audience is composed of other businesspeople, the language and examples used will be
different than if the audience is composed of students. When preparing oral presentations, employees
need to consider the age, educational level, and interests of the audience in order to give presentations
that will appeal to that specific group of people. After identifying the audience, employees organize their
notes, develop appropriate visuals, and practice the speech in order to make sure that they are prepared
for the presentation.

5. B
Expect to revise. It is usually not possible for the first draft of written communications to be the most
effective. Therefore, businesspeople should expect to revise written messages at least once, and
generally several times. During the revision stage, businesspeople check for accuracy of content and
proofread for errors in spelling and punctuation. Reading over the message several times in order to
reorganize information or check for mistakes will help businesspeople to prepare effective written
communications. Although it may be necessary to ask others for help when writing, it is usually not
necessary to plan a meeting. Oral communications involves the use of the right tone of voice.
Businesspeople often work with others to prepare effective written communications.

A quote stating the number of children who are homeless. To capture the attention of readers, a
persuasive letter must grab their attention and get them in a receptive mood. Jana's job qualifications and
other types of background information, such as the number of rooms in the shelter, should not be
presented until the readers understand why it is important for them to hear this message. Asking the
readers to do something to help should come after the readers have been persuaded that the cause or
topic of the letter is important.

Progress. Marketing personnel often prepare simple reports to keep managers informed of the progress
and current status of activities and projects. These progress reports are short and contain only the
information needed to keep managers and other staff informed. Proposal reports recommend trying new
projects or activities. Employee reports concern staff performance. Abstract reports summarize
complicated or lengthy material.

Justification report. Analytical reports are documents that evaluate issues, opportunities, or problems. A
justification report is a type of analytical report that evaluates the success or failure of a previous decision
or course of action. In the recommendations section of a justification report, the writer may validate the
decision, suggest improvements, or describe why an action has been ineffective. A market analysis is a

No, some business policies are clear-cut and need no explanation. These policies are often displayed in
writing on posters or signs at various locations within the business so that customers can read them for
themselves. For example, a business may post signs that it will prosecute shoplifters. This policy is clear
and does not need to be explained to customers. Not all business policies are this clear, and they do
need to be explained. The business can, however, follow the policies it has established whether or not

While discussing sports during a luncheon meeting in Liverpool, England, U.S. businessperson Colt
Marconi made the victory sign with the palm of his hand facing him. To avoid offending people,
businesspeople should learn about the country's cultural norms, including verbal and nonverbal
communication. While a victory sign may be an acceptable gesture (nonverbal communication) in the
U.S., it is offensive to British people. Using the appropriate title (e.g., Sir John) to greet a businessperson
is acceptable verbal communication. An example of unacceptable verbal communication in England is

You gain others' respect. Most people do not like to make mistakes, but everyone makes them from time

responsibility means admitting the wrongdoing, accepting the consequences of the decision, and trying to
do better the next time. When a person admits making a mistake, s/he is likely to gain the respect of
others and gain trust. When people do not admit their mistakes or they blame others for mistakes, they
are showing that they value their well-being over others, which is demonstrating self-importance. Most
people do not trust individuals who do not accept responsibility for their actions or decisions, and are
likely to be skeptical about those individuals' true motives. People cannot control others' opinions.

more successful when they target the right customer and do not try to be "all things to all people." A

software to be user-friendly, easy-to-use and operate. Most companies do not want a lot of people to
have access to their financial data, so it is important to keep it secure and accessible for those who need
and use the information. Accounting systems require some type of maintenance because people must
continuously update the information. Accounting systems do not produce results for the business—they
simply store information in an organized way.

face other types of legal action. With regard to the accounting process, it is not necessary for all

Protect the well-being of the business's employees and customers. Governments develop and enforce
various regulations to protect the well-being of society. If a business is not following safety regulations, it
is not protecting the well-being of its employees and customers. An employee should report the
noncompliance so the government can step in and ensure that the business takes corrective action
before an accident occurs and someone is injured. By reporting noncompliance of safety regulations, the
employee may prevent a tragedy from occurring and prevent the business from receiving poor publicity
and a bad reputation that would likely result from an accident or injury. Although it depends on the type of
product, it is often legal for a business to sell substitute goods to consumers. Labor laws, rather than
safety regulations, regulate the ways in which businesses pay their employees.

Evacuate the premises. A fire is an example of an emergency situation that business employees should
be prepared to handle. One of the first procedures to follow if a fire is detected in the facility is to
evacuate the premises to protect the safety of customers as well as employees. Getting everyone out of
the building is extremely important. Employees should already know where the fire extinguishers are
located and be able to use them if appropriate. However, they should first evacuate the premises before
the fire gets out of control. After everyone is safely outside, it would be appropriate to contact corporate
headquarters. Employees would not hide the valuables.

A new customer's check is for an amount larger than the purchase total. The customer's check may be
valid, or it may be a bad check because there is not enough money in the customer's account to honor
the check. If the business accepts a bad check, the bank will not honor the check, and the business will
lose not only the value of the customer's purchase but the additional cash as well. To protect themselves,
some businesses require checks for more than the purchase total to be approved by a manager. A
regular customer who brings in a new neighbor does not represent a risk to the business. Most
customers are rightfully impatient when they are kept waiting by telephone transactions. Photo
identification is considered the most acceptable form because it carries both a picture and a signature.

Returning an urgent telephone call from an important customer. Prioritizing involves ranking things in the
order of their relative importance. Employees evaluate many factors when prioritizing their work,
including due dates and the time that it will take to complete a task. Oftentimes, things come up that
require immediate attention, which means an employee might need to reprioritize tasks. Returning an
urgent telephone call from an important customer should be the employee's top priority. Faxing a
purchase order that a vendor needs the next day and preparing a simple report that is due in one week
should be the next priorities. If the employee has completed those tasks, then s/he can read the online
newsletter about industry trends.

Timing. When tasks need to be completed in sequential order, one team member cannot start his/her
task until another team member has completed her/his task. If one team member runs behind, it affects
all other team members who must complete tasks after that team member. This can create bottlenecks
and can cause delays and missed deadlines. Therefore, it is important to coordinate tasks so that
sufficient time is allocated to complete each task. Durability and pricing may be factors when coordinating
certain types of projects; however, these factors may or may not be tied to the tasking sequence.

Change. Change is something that occurs constantly and usually without warning. When developing a
project plan, a business should always provide for change because it is inevitable that something will
change. For example, a customer may add a new requirement or need a larger quantity. Being prepared
to deal with any changes that may take place during the course of the project will help to make the
project successful. Not all projects require research or secrecy. Businesses don't provide for publicity

dates, he is analyzing the schedule to detect variances or differences among desired and actual
information. By analyzing schedule variances, he can determine where bottlenecks are occurring, where
processes may be inefficient or where resources are unavailable. Then, he can take corrective action to
get back on track. Financial reports are used to evaluate cost discrepancies and profit margins.

Assess vendors' strengths and weaknesses. By assessing a vendor's strengths and weaknesses before

the negotiating process. Planning and developing effective strategies can help the business obtain
desired discounts, favorable service options, or cooperative advertising support. And, the business may
make fewer concessions during the negotiation because it analyzed the vendor's capabilities before
beginning negotiations. To obtain a favorable agreement, the business should strive for a win-win
attitude. Adopting a win-lose attitude and using overly aggressive tactics may backfire, and prevent both
parties from getting what they want from the negotiation.

Break-even point. The break-even point is the level of sales at which revenues equal total costs. In
determining selling price, businesses calculate their total costs, including operating expenses, in order to
find the break-even point. It is important to factor in all operating expenses when calculating the breakeven
point in order to set the selling price that will cover all operating expenses and make a profit for the
business. Gross profit is the money left after cost of goods expense is subtracted from total income.
Start-up costs are all of the expenses involved in setting up a new business or introducing a new product
to the market. Start-up costs are one factor that may be considered when calculating the break-even
point. Money supply is the total quantity of money which exists at one time in a nation.

An expanding company creates a new department to support a developing product line. A job promotion
occurs when an employee advances to another position that often provides the individual with increased
responsibility and compensation as well as a new job title. Companies often provide their employees with
opportunities to advance within the organization because they are familiar with many aspects of the
organization (e.g., products, climate). A company that creates a new department needs people to carry
out the work. Therefore, the new department provides an opportunity for advancement for current
employees. When a partner leaves a partnership, the partnership generally dissolves and requires legal
restructuring. Temporary workers are individuals who work on a short-term basis to carry out a
business's tasks and objectives. Although some temporary employees secure permanent positions, it
does not necessarily mean that they are placed in different positions. When a layoff situation occurs,
people lose their jobs and promotion opportunities generally decrease.

Using production equipment without appropriate safety gear. A company's rules of conduct outline its
policies and expectations regarding employees' behavior in the workplace. A company expects its
employees to follow safety precautions to protect themselves, their coworkers, and their customers. If an
employee violates safety procedures, the company is likely to reprimand or discipline the employee. A
reprimand involves a verbal warning, usually for a first offense. If the inappropriate behavior continues,
more severe disciplinary actions may involve counseling, revoking privileges, and implementing unpaid

Motivating. Directing is the management function of providing guidance to workers and work projects. A
directing activity is motivating employees, which is prompting them to continue a certain behavior or to
take a certain action. When a manager provides employees with positive verbal feedback for their
performance or offers monetary incentives for them to achieve certain goals, the manager is motivating
employees. Supervising involves monitoring the work effort. Coordinating involves linking activities to
achieve a desired outcome. Producing involves combining inputs to create outputs—making goods or
services.
