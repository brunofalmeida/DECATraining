1. B
Contract. Contracts are agreements between two or more parties stating that one party is to do
something in return for something provided by another party. If one travel business promises to do
something for another travel business in return for receiving compensation, the two businesses have a
contract. Then, the businesses are obligated to fulfill their part of the contract. In most cases, contracts
benefit both parties, although promising to do something in return for receiving compensation is not
necessarily a benefit. A partnership is a form of business ownership in which the business is owned by
two or more persons. A guarantee is a promise to the consumer that a product's purchase price will be
refunded if the product is not satisfactory.

2. C
Discrimination. Various workplace regulations protect all types of employees from discrimination,
including employees who have disabilities. Employers may not discriminate against disabled workers if
the workers are qualified and capable of performing the work. The laws also require travel and tourism
businesses to provide reasonable accommodation so that disabled employees are able to access
buildings and use equipment. Businesses often install ramps, elevators, and hand rails to make their
facilities accessible to both employees and customers with disabilities. The laws regulating reasonable
accommodation do not protect employees from hazardous conditions, accidents, or unsafe
environments. However, there are other laws that cover these issues.

3. D
Implementing an automatic identification system. An automatic identification system uses electronic bar
coding symbols to transmit information. Businesses often use bar coding as a way to keep track of their
inventory and reorder stock. Bar coding eliminates the need to process inventory manually, which takes
much more time and is subject to a higher rate of error. Although tracking shipping expenses through a
database system and developing web sites require technology to operate, products do not necessarily
move through the distribution chain more efficiently. Use of networked trading communities can
potentially increase the efficiency of product movement. However, merely encouraging use of networked
systems does not increase product movement efficiency.

4. C
Coordinate their efforts. Distribution channel members are the businesses or individuals who assist in
moving the travel and/or tourism services from the producer to the consumer. So consumers get the
products they want when they need them, the channel members must work together or coordinate their
efforts to efficiently transfer the services. This involves fostering positive relationships, which requires
open, ongoing communication to accomplish the common goal of satisfying the customer. In most
situations, the distribution chain has a channel leader (e.g., producer) that possesses more power or
leverage than the other channel members.

5. C
Distribution intensity. Channel members are all of the individuals and businesses that move goods and
services from the producer to the end user. A travel and tourism business must determine how many
intermediaries to use in order to reach a market or market segment. High intensity means that the travel
and tourism business uses as many intermediaries as possible to reach as many end users as possible.
Low intensity involves selecting a few intermediaries to make the travel and tourism products available
when and where they are desired. Channel management refers to all of the management functions (e.g.,
planning, organizing, and controlling) that a supply chain uses. Intermediary concentration is a fictitious
term. Exclusive is a distribution strategy that uses a few intermediaries, which may be dealerships.

6. D
Provide supporting information. When employees present their ideas to management or coworkers, they
should be prepared to defend those ideas and provide supporting information. Being prepared will help
employees remain objective and be able to offer logical evidence to back up their ideas. Employees
should be prepared to explain supporting information because others may have questions or concerns
about the ideas. It is usually not necessary for employees to write technical research reports to defend
their ideas. The use of aggressive body language may offend others. Employees do not need to
demonstrate a sense of leadership when defending their ideas. The best approach is to be prepared.

Nominal group. The nominal group technique encourages all of the staff members' participation in the
meeting, including those who might not speak out voluntarily. This technique allows even the quiet
employees to express their opinions in staff meetings. Brainstorming involves having all members of a
group throw out as many ideas as possible for consideration. Role-playing involves giving group
members a situation and assigning them roles to act out the situation. Quality circles are fairly small
groups of employees who meet on a regular basis to discuss problems and work situations and to
provide input to management.

To verify reservations. Most tour operators prepare confirmation letters to send to clients to verify
reservations on an upcoming tour. The confirmation letters contain information about the dates of the
tour, number of passengers, price, etc. In many cases, the letter contains a confirmation number that
guarantees a client's place on the tour. Tour operators do not prepare confirmation letters to prevent
overbooking, request deposits, or describe baggage.

Predeparture briefing. Before a tour departs, a tour manager usually conducts a briefing with the
passengers to review the itinerary, hand out travel documents, and answer any last minute questions.
The purpose of the predeparture briefing is to make sure passengers are aware of what will take place on
the tour. It is also an opportunity to explain any general rules and regulations, discuss seating
assignments, and give passengers a chance to get to know each other, as well as the tour manager.
Reviewing the itinerary, handing out travel documents, and answering questions are not tasks that a tour
manager performs in relation to conducting a marketing presentation, a training session, or an
operational workshop.

Pleases the customer. Taking swift action to handle a customer's complaint makes the customer feel that
s/he and the problem are both important to the business. It creates an image of a business that is
interested in satisfying its customers. Taking quick action does not necessarily save the manager time or
make the situation easier to handle. It does not eliminate the need to investigate the problem because all
complaints need to be investigated.

To sell products. Travel agencies sell travel and tourism products to individuals and businesses. As such,
they need to promote their various travel and tourism products, and an effective way to do that is to stock
display racks with attractive brochures and pamphlets. These promotional materials attract customers
and help to sell the travel and tourism products. Travel agents can also use the materials as sales tools
by giving them to clients to promote the various products that are available. Travel agencies do not stock
display racks with promotional brochures to entertain clients, decorate lobbies, or advertise contests.

Pure and speculative. Pure risks are risks that carry with them the possibility of loss or no loss.
Speculative risks are those risks that may result in a loss, no change, or a gain. Fires and floods are two

Acquire foreign language skills. The workplace is becoming more global and multinational. In order to be
successful, cruise line employees need to develop their sensitivity to other cultures and traditions. One
way that they can do this is to acquire foreign language skills. By learning something about the language
of their customers or coworkers, they will develop an understanding of the foreign culture and become
more sensitive to, and understanding of, the differences. Cruise line employees do not develop cultural
sensitivity by revising research techniques, maintaining current leadership styles, or preserving
communication methods. In fact, businesspeople may need to revise their style of leadership and change
the way they communicate in order to develop cultural sensitivity.

Climate of trust. Before a cruise ship's employees can work together as a team, they need to trust one
another. Cruise directors can help by creating a climate of trust. One way to do this is to encourage the
cruise ship's employees to get to know each other better and talk about what they hope to accomplish.
Once the cruise ship's employees trust each other, they can share ideas and provide support that will
enable them to function as an effective team. Cruise directors who are controlling and follow a strict line
of authority often discourage employees from developing teams. Resistance to change often makes it
difficult to build teams.

Guide or direct others. A person who wants to lead change in the workplace must have the ability to
guide or direct others with the intention to transform or alter something. Getting people to change
involves guiding or directing them to do something in a different way. People usually will not follow the
lead of another person if that person cannot provide guidance or direction. A person who wants to lead
change often needs to answer a variety of questions to explain the need for change. A person who wants

Verify credentials. When selecting a financial-services provider, it is important to make sure that the
provider is qualified. One way to do this is to verify the provider's credentials. In many areas, financialservices
providers must pass an exam or obtain a license. These credentials verify that the provider has
the necessary training and background to give financial advice, help develop financial plans, and make
investments. Although it is usually necessary to make an appointment to meet with a financial-services
provider, that is not an important step to take when selecting the provider. Individuals organize their
records before meeting with a financial-services provider. Planning an investment takes place after
selecting a qualified provider.

Going concern. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are universal rules that accountants
use when they prepare and summarize financial reports. Presenting financial information in a consistent
format helps accounting professionals understand financial information across many types of businesses
and industries. When setting up an accounting system, accountants consider three assumptions—going
concern, business entity, and accounting period. Going concern assumes that the business will go on
forever (indefinitely). Business entity is the assumption that the owner(s) and the business are
independent units. The third assumption is the accounting period, which indicates that each business is
divided into specific increments of time for the purpose of reporting financial data (e.g., month, quarter,
annual). Tangible existence and open reality are fictitious terms.

To exist. Money must flow into a charter-bus company before it can ever exist. Entrepreneurs usually

of money is used to purchase the goods and services needed to start the business. Businesses receive
money from the sale of goods and services. Entrepreneurs often obtain start-up money by borrowing it
from investors.

$106,640. An important part of developing a tour company's budget is determining the amount to allocate
for salaries and wages. Since payroll accounts for a major portion of the expenses, it is vital that tour
businesses budget that amount as accurately as possible. To determine next year's budget for payroll,
first calculate the pay raises by multiplying the current salary by the percent of increase ($28,000 x 3% or
.03 = $840; and $16,000 x 2% or .02 = $320). Add those amounts to the current salaries to determine
next year's salaries ($28,000 + $840 = $28,840, and $16,000 + $320 = $16,320). Then, multiply the
salaries by the number of employees ($28,840 x 2 = $57,680 and $16,320 x 3 = $48,960). Add the two
totals to determine the amount to budget for next year's salaries and wages ($57,680 + $48,960 =
$106,640).

Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the time that a car rental company takes to turn assets (e.g., equipment,
property) into cash so it can pay the company's debts. Liability is defined as debt that an individual or a

Not included in the overall price. Cruise ship passengers often purchase items, such as souvenirs and
refreshments, that are not included in the overall price of the cruise. When passengers make these
purchases, the cruise ship adds them to the individual passenger's account by posting the charges to a
passenger's bill. A cruise ship auditor reviews the postings on a daily basis to make sure that all
transactions are placed on the correct account, and that all transactions are correctly accounted for and
balanced. Most transactions are charged to a cabin rather than a credit card, and a passenger pays the
balance at the end of the cruise. This balance might be charged to a credit card. Transactions are not
deducted from a savings account or added to the petty cash fund.

To obtain in-depth information. To obtain in-depth answers to questions, it is always best to use openended
questions when interviewing job applicants for a travel agency position. An open-ended question
is not a type of question that requires a simple "yes" or "no" answer. An example of an open-ended
question is, "What do you like best about your current job?" This type of question requires the applicant
to provide a detailed explanation. Assumptive questions check for understanding. The asking of openended
questions usually lengthens the interview process and generates long answers.

companies, and sending out customer surveys would not provide the right kind of information.

Negotiate for better rates. The travel department of a large business is often able to negotiate with
suppliers for better rates because of the volume of travel. For example, if many employees routinely fly
from one city to another and spend several nights in a hotel, the travel department might be able to
obtain a lower rate with one airline because of the number of trips that will be made each month. Also,
the department might be able to negotiate a discounted rate at a hotel based on the number of rooms
that will be occupied. Suppliers are often willing to negotiate special rates with groups, which is what a
business actually is. Both individuals and company travel departments are able to make reservations
quickly, access industry web sites, and obtain confirmation numbers.

Employee receives a percentage of sales. The straight commission plan pays the employee an agreedupon
percent of sales. This method of compensation is often used by travel and tourism businesses that
have outside salespeople. The salespeople are compensated in direct relation to their volume of sales.
For example, if a salesperson is paid 7% of his/her sales, the salesperson is encouraged to sell as much
as possible to generate more income. Paying a fixed rate for each unit of production is an example of the
piece-rate method of compensation. Paying a flat rate of money each month is the straight salary method
of compensation. Paying a rate based on hours worked is an hourly method of compensation.

To track usage. Some travel agencies' computers place information, a "cookie," on a visitor's hard drive
when the visitor accesses a travel agency's web site. The next time a user visits that site, the site's
computer recognizes the user because of the cookie. Travel agencies use cookies to maintain visitor
information and track how many times a user visits a specific web site or buys a travel product. This type
of data allows travel agencies to customize web sites in order to appeal to the preferences and habits of
the consumers who are visiting their sites. The use of cookies does not ensure privacy, protect data, or

Marketing-information management system. A marketing-information management system is an
organized way of continuously gathering, sorting, analyzing, evaluating, and distributing information.
Many tour companies develop this type of system in order to be able to analyze sales records and other
related data, and use the data to make marketing decisions. It is not enough simply for tour companies to
gather marketing information; they also must analyze the information so it will be useful in the future. For
example, tour companies are not able to make decisions about marketing to their target customers
unless they understand who these customers are and what types of travel and tourism products they
want and need. A comprehensive research procedure involves the system used to obtain information.
Spreadsheet-software programs are used to analyze financial data. An Internet operating technique is a
way of accessing and using the Internet.

for the research project. External, primary data are data gathered outside the firm specifically for the

Identify the target market. The target market is the particular group of customers a tour operator seeks to

that market. The operator needs to know who makes up this market, the demographics and
psychographics of the market, and any other relevant information. Then, the operator can use this
information to design tours that the target market is likely to buy. Tour operators visit new attractions on a
regular basis to determine if they will appeal to the target market. After identifying the target market, a
tour operator would contact hotels and arrange transportation in order to develop specific tours.

which often are experiences. In this example, the escorted bus tour is a travel experience that
participants enjoy. It is not a tangible product, although the bus and lodging facilities are physical items.
The difference is that participants purchase the experience of the bus tour rather than the bus or the hotel
room. The use of the bus and the hotel room are part of the experience. Dinner, souvenirs, and postcards
are tangible items that can be marketed and sold. They may add to the overall travel experience, but they

External threat attacking an internal weakness. External threats often create problems for a tour
wholesaler's internal weaknesses. For example, a SWOT analysis indicates that customers' buying
preferences are changing; however, the business has a very limited product line. The external threat is
that customers want a different type of product; but the tour wholesaler only offers a limited number of
tour packages, which is a weakness. The problem for the tour wholesaler is that customers will buy from
other companies that offer more variety. Unless the tour wholesaler can adjust and overcome its
weakness, it will probably lose sales. The SWOT analysis did not indicate an internal strength responding
to an external threat, an internal weakness compensating for an external threat, or an external
opportunity coinciding with an internal strength.

Detailed product description. An effective marketing plan contains several components, and one of them
deals with marketing strategy, which is the plan of action for achieving marketing goals and objectives.
An important part of the marketing strategy section is a detailed description of the business's product.
This description should explain the product and the features and benefits it provides customers. Before a
business can develop strategies to market a product, it needs to have a clear understanding of its
product and why customers will want or need it. Once it understands the product, a business can
determine the appropriate price to charge and how to make the product available to customers. The
marketing strategy component of a marketing plan does not include a list of current employees, an
explanation of accounting methods, or a proposed annual budget.

Buy directly from suppliers. The technology that allowed for the creation of the Internet and the World

computer and access to the Internet can go online to obtain information about airline flights, cruises, hotel
accommodations, etc., and buy those products online from the supplier. For example, a customer can
access the home page of America West Airlines, select a flight, book the flight, pay for the flight, and
download a boarding pass. This eliminates the middleman, or the travel agent, and allows customers to

Establishing safety guidelines. Travel agencies should establish safety guidelines for employees to follow
in order to create a safe working environment. Employees who are aware of general safety procedures
are less likely to make mistakes that cause accidents. While many kinds of equipment are safe when
used properly, not all equipment is or can be accident proof. Purchasing insurance will reimburse the
travel agency for losses resulting from accidents, but won't prevent them.

Windows and doors are locked. Travel agencies may prevent burglaries by making a physical check of
every room in the business to make sure no one is left in the building and that all windows and doors are
locked. The simple procedure of locking all windows and doors may deter burglars because it will be
difficult for them to gain access to the travel agency. Cleaning public areas, turning off electrical
equipment, and transferring telephones will not prevent burglaries.

Teamwork. Teamwork is a cooperative effort of two or more people working together to reach a common
goal. Teamwork is important to an incentive travel planning company's success. When employees work
together and with the incentive travel company to improve themselves and the products of the business,
the result is usually quality. The combination of continual improvement and teamwork creates quality
products, a quality atmosphere in the incentive travel planning company, and quality service for the
customers. Incentive travel companies that have a quality culture often develop goodwill with the
community and customers. Research and security may contribute to improvement, but teamwork is also
needed to develop a quality culture.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses are the costs of running a business. They may be variable or
fixed but do not include the costs of items purchased for resale, or the cost of goods sold. Fixed costs are
business costs that are not affected by changes in sales volume. An example is rent. Variable costs are
business costs that change according to changes in sales volume. An example would be increased
salary expense due to the hiring of more salespeople.

Make a mental note of the robber's appearance. Although a robbery is a stressful situation, travel agency
employees should try to look at the robber and make a mental note of the robber's appearance. This
includes trying to determine height, weight, hair color, etc., as well as any unique features, such as a scar
or a tattoo. Taking the time to get a good look at the robber will be helpful in giving the police an accurate
description. Employees should comply with the robber's demands as quickly as possible. Employees
should not volunteer information, such as saying that the agency's safe is locked, because the robber
may not know there is a safe. Employees should attempt to set off the alarm system only if they are sure
it is silent and that the robber will not notice what they are doing.

Education. Individuals should stress their education and achievements at school when they have very
little work experience. Prospective employers are interested in finding out if the applicants have the
training and ability to perform well on the job. If applicants explain that they have the educational
background to do the work, prospective employers are often willing to interview them. Information about
references is listed in a resume. Letters of application usually do not contain information about an
individual's personality or activities unless those activities relate directly to the job.

companies a chance to see what competitors are doing. Analyzing marketing needs and hiring new
employees are not main benefits of trade show participation.

Tourism is seasonal. Tourism is seasonal based on the time of year and the location of the destination.
For example, travelers visit beach destinations when the weather is warm, and visit ski destinations when
it is cold and there is a lot of snow. Those types of destinations experience a decrease in visitors during
other times of the year. As a result, airlines that service these destinations usually increase or decrease
the number of daily flights to accommodate the demand. Airlines do not increase or decrease the number
of daily flights to certain vacation destinations because airports are closed, weather is predictable, or
pilots are unavailable.

Mountains. The geography of an area includes its physical characteristics, such as mountains, beaches,
lakes, etc. The geography of an area is a factor that impacts travel and tourism for the area. Mountainous
areas in colder climates are often suitable locations for ski resorts and facilities. Visitors are drawn to
those areas because the mountains offer challenging and interesting ski trails. Forests are a geographic
factor but are not the main factor because an abundance of trees is a potential hazard for skiers.
Accommodations and highways are man-made factors rather than geographic factors that draw visitors
to certain regions.

Exchange price. The exchange price is the amount of money that the buyer is willing to pay and the seller
is willing to accept for a good or service. When a travel product is sold, the buyers and sellers have
agreed on a value for the travel product, which is the exchange rate. For example, if an airline offers an
airline ticket for $250 and customers agree to pay that amount, the exchange rate is $250. Price policy is
a guideline regulating the range of prices for goods and services that businesses offer to customers.
Equilibrium price is the point at which the quantity of a good that buyers want to buy is equal to the
quantity that sellers are willing to sell at a certain price. Price lining is the practice of selling
goods/services at a limited number of predetermined price points, or levels.

A new law increases minimum wage. This change would increase costs for the tourist attraction by
forcing it to pay higher wages to entry-level workers. The result might be a raise in prices to cover the
added expense. Increased efficiency and a reduction of inventory level would decrease prices. Laying off
workers would either stabilize or reduce prices.

Idea generation. New travel and tourism products begin with ideas. Idea generation is the process of
thinking up or creating new plans and schemes and is often used in creating new products and modifying
existing products. Many travel and tourism companies solicit new ideas on a continuous basis as part of
the product/service management program. Business analysis is examining such factors as demand,
costs, competition, capital investment required, and potential profit of a good or service to determine how
it will fit into the company's product mix. Test marketing is the process of introducing a new product to a
limited market to determine what its acceptance will be. Concept testing is exploring the concept, or idea,
for a product in order to obtain feedback.

Market opportunity. When a situation exists to fulfill a market's unmet needs, there is a market
opportunity. Entrepreneurs and businesses in the travel and tourism industry use creative-thinking
techniques during the product-development process, which involves finding ways to take advantage of
the market opportunity that presents itself. Mind mapping is a creative-thinking technique that involves
generating ideas by making associations. To begin the mind-mapping process, a tour wholesaler writes
the problem or market opportunity in the center of a large sheet of paper. From that starting point, the
tour wholesaler draws lines to other words or phrases that relate to the main idea (problem or market
opportunity), and continues the process by making associations, which generates ideas and identifies
possible solutions. The mind-mapping starting point does not begin by writing down supporting facts or
primary associations. A situational analysis is a determination of a firm's current business situation and
the direction in which the business is headed.

Recognize opportunities. Tour operators often use a variety of processes to understand customers'
buying behavior and find out what they might want in the future. Interviewing customers and conducting
surveys are processes that many tour operators use. The intent is to obtain information that will help tour
operators recognize opportunities. Tour operators need ongoing information to be able to respond to
changes in the marketplace and take advantage of new opportunities. Tour operators do not use these
processes simply to collect information, but to use the information to recognize opportunities. Tour
operators may develop and send out questionnaires to find out what customers might want in the future.
Tour operators do not find out what customers might want in the future to generate advertising.

Quantity. A quantity standard is developed by business to measure the amount of work produced. Travel
agencies set quantity standards in order to operate on a level that will help them obtain their goals and
realize profits. A quality standard measures the degree of excellence of a good or service. A time
standard monitors the amount of time needed to complete specific business activities. A cost standard
measures how much a product or project costs.

Federal Trade Commission. Laws administered by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) forbid false,
misleading, or deceptive advertising of consumer products. The FTC considers advertising deceptive
when it is used to lure clients to the travel agency in order to sell them another travel product when they
arrive. This is called the bait-and-switch advertising method. An example of this method is a travel
agency that advertises a free gift with the purchase of a certain travel product (e.g., cruise), but then
requires clients to buy a more expensive product in order to receive the gift. The Food and Drug
Administration is the regulatory agency established by the federal government to enforce laws that
protect consumers' health. The Federal Communications Commission is a government regulatory agency
that grants licenses to radio and television stations and regulates interstate telephone and telegraph
rates and service. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is the regulatory agency established by
the federal government to enforce product safety laws.

Social environment. The social and cultural environment in which people live changes over time. The
desire for new travel and tourism opportunities is growing because of changes in society. For example,
as baby boomers age and retire, they have more time to travel for leisure. Travel agencies that do not
regularly review products to make sure they fill customer needs and wants may not be able to continue
selling their products. Operating method, promotional technique, and distribution system usually do not
have an effect on whether products fill customer needs and wants.

Travel writers. Travel writers usually are invited on familiarization, or FAM, tours, which are planned to
acquaint them with an area and its attractions. These individuals could tour the area and write articles for
publications, which would attract visitors to the area for the event. The promotional influence of pilots is
limited. Economic developers usually are not included in FAM tours. State dignitaries may tour the area
as part of an official celebration but not as a part of a FAM tour.

Symbols. Symbols are designs, logos, characters, objects, colors, etc., that create recognition and
differentiate one travel and tourism business from another. Businesses often develop unique symbols
that, over time, become associated with the specific business. Customers only need to see the symbols
to recognize the business. A copyright is legal protection of books and other artistic works granted by
government, giving their creators sole rights to them for 28 years. A patent is legal protection of an

Gift wrapping. One advantage that a cruise line gift shop can provide its customers is gift-wrapping,
which is a convenience for the cruise line's guests. Guests can purchase gifts for family and friends and
have the gift shop wrap the items for them, which makes the gifts look nice for the recipient. Because
cruise line gift shops are on water, they do not offer free vehicle parking. Credit is the arrangement by
which businesses or individuals purchase now and pay later. Most cruise ship guests pay for travel goods
and services with cash, travel checks, or credit cards. Since financial institutions determine the credit
terms for credit cards, the cruise ship does not usually develop credit options for guests. Layaway is a
type of sale in which merchandise is removed from the sales floor and held by the gift shop until the
customer can pay the balance. Because most cruises are short trips, gift shops do not offer long-term
layaway.

Customs in foreign countries. When developing a brand, business owners need to consider the likelihood
of doing business internationally. If this is a possibility, they need to determine how compatible their
brands will be with foreign customs and cultures, as well as how their brand name will translate into
foreign languages. Whether foreign customers like to shop or how many credit cards are issued in foreign
countries are not brand considerations for doing business internationally, although these factors may
weigh into more fundamental business decisions. Businesses should not consider whether their brands
can possibly change foreign cultures. Instead, they should try to fit into and complement foreign cultures.

Key attractions. Many customers select escorted tours based on the various destinations and the key
attractions available at those destinations. Therefore, tour operators should be familiar with all the
attractions and plan a tour that includes sites of interest. For example, if a tour operator is planning a
historical tour, it would be inappropriate to select destinations that do not include historical attractions,
such as old forts or battle sites. Natural resources are items that are found in nature and used to produce
goods and services. Regional dialects and local industries are not considerations when planning
destinations for an escorted tour.

Geography. The geography of a site is a variable that often makes the site unique and has an effect on
the travel and tourism product. For example, some sites are popular because they are located in the
mountains while other sites are popular because they are located on the shore. These are geographical
factors that attract visitors who are interested in those specific features. The geography changes from
one site to another and affects the type of travel and tourism product. The product in the mountains might
be skiing, whereas the product on the shore might be sport fishing. Transportation is the method of
traveling to the site. Itinerary explains the components of a tour. A reservation holds a hotel room or
cruise for a certain time period.

publicity that stimulate customer/client purchases. Other examples of sales promotion include premiums,
coupons, and free samples. Publicity is a nonpersonal form of promotion that is not paid for by the

and may include additional information about the business. World Travel Service's ad must include the

Manufacturers' promotional campaigns. Local businesses are able to gain the benefit of additional
advertising by tying their promotions to the manufacturers' national campaigns. Manufacturers usually
run special promotions several times a year, which gives local businesses the opportunity to obtain
additional advertising without great expense. Competing businesses usually do not coordinate their
promotional efforts. Coordinating a promotion with specials offered at the mall would be effective only if
the business was located in the mall. Taking advantage of the discounts offered by one radio station
would not be an example of coordinating promotional activities.

Frustrated salespeople. Selling policies may create some negative side effects that tour companies
should try to limit. One negative effect might be frustrated salespeople if the selling policies excessively
restrict a salesperson's normal authority. Tour companies need to develop selling policies that provide
salespeople with the guidelines they need to sell effectively, but also allow them a certain amount of
freedom when dealing with customers. Negligent vendors, distracted customers, and careless
management are not examples of negative effects of a tour company's selling policies.

facilities while others do not. It is important for a travel agent to reserve the type of sleeping room that will

All passengers pay a port charge in addition to the cruise fare. The amount of the port charge is
determined by the ports encountered and the length of the cruise. If space is available, cruises can be
booked with little notice. Cabins with portholes (windows) are usually more expensive than cabins without
portholes. Cancellation insurance or the Cancellation Fees Waiver Policy must be purchased when the
deposit is paid.

Accountable. The Airline Reporting Corporation (ARC) is the organization that distributes airline tickets
that travel agents sell to their clients. Each accountable airline ticket is assigned a specific serial number
that is used to track ticket inventory. When a travel agent voids an accountable airline ticket, s/he must
report the ticket's serial number to the ARC for security reasons (e.g., theft prevention). Disposable,
recyclable, and unauthorized are not terms commonly used to describe a type of airline ticket that must
be tracked and reported to the ARC.

Strategies and policies. Regional sales managers are in middle management positions and are
responsible for implementing the travel business's overall sales strategies and policies. They follow the
direction of top management, and carry out the plans of action that top management identifies. They are
concerned with achieving the goals set by top management. Regional sales managers often supervise
first-level managers who are responsible for overseeing customer service, and monitoring day-to-day
sales activities. A travel business's human resources department usually handles wage and commission
plans.

Percent. An electronic cash register can calculate discounts for employees. The employee enters 50 and
then touches the percent (%) key after the sale amount of the check. The register automatically
calculates or subtracts 50% from the item on the check. The No Sale key is used to open the cash
drawer when a sales transaction is not in process. The purpose of the Refund key is to record cash
refunds. The Conversion key is used to convert payment to a different currency.

Provide an overview of currency exchange along with exchange rates for host countries. Many
international travelers do not understand the ins and outs of currency exchange, including options for
accessing foreign currency before and during a trip and how to use an exchange rate. Although
exchange rates change daily, offering a current list of rates for countries the clients will visit will give them
a basis for calculating costs. Clients may be well-advised to take a credit card but should also have cash
available, as not all merchants accept credit cards and some only accept certain kinds. While travelers
can use ATMs to make cash withdrawals abroad, these machines are not easily accessible in many
countries and are not available in others. They should not be relied upon as the chief means of access to
money. Clients should convert leftover foreign currency before returning home. Some countries make it
illegal to leave with their currency, and foreign money is not always easy to convert once home.

Company description, financial plan, and marketing plan. A comprehensive business plan consists of
many elements including detailed financial, marketing, product, service, management, operating, and
legal plans. The company description defines the type and purpose of the business. The summary is an
overview that highlights the main points of the various plans. Although some businesses might include
information, such as franchise agreements, annual reports, and sales reports, these items are not always
applicable to the business and, therefore, are not always components that are included in a business
plan.

Set appropriate standards. To control business activities effectively, managers must set appropriate
standards to be able to measure the productivity of a specific activity. Although controlling business
activities might require managers to identify communication channels, request employee feedback, and
initiate corrective action, standards must be in place to understand the type of control that is needed.
