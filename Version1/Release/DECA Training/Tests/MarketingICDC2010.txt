 1. D
Following legal procedure. Legal procedure refers to the methods that are used to protect an individual's
or business's legal rights. Each jurisdiction's court system requires that certain procedures be followed to
ensure fair treatment to both the plaintiff and the defendant. This involves following legal procedures to
file complaints with the court, to serve documents to the opposition, and to exhibit proper behavior with
witnesses and jurors during court proceedings. The purpose of legal procedures is to provide consistent
and fair treatment to all parties involved in a legal dispute. The judicial system does not develop contracts
or implement laws; it rules on contract validity by interpreting laws.

Needs to maintain tight control over a product. Exclusive distribution involves selling a product through
one intermediary or middlemen, in a geographic area. Exclusive distribution is often preferred for
specialty, highly complex, and technical products, or products that require special handling or training,
such as airplanes or large machinery. When a business wants to deal with intermediaries that will do the
best job to promote and sell their products, it would use selective distribution. Selective distribution
means selling a product through a limited number of wholesalers and retailers in a geographic location. A
business that wants to bypass middlemen (intermediaries) would choose a direct-distribution strategy.
Intensive distribution involves selling a product (e.g., candy bars) through every available wholesaler and
retailer in a geographic area where consumers might look for the product.

 3. A
Contact the customer and ask him/her what color s/he wants. An important aspect of customer service is
making sure the customer gets what s/he wants when s/he needs it. If Sasha has incomplete information
to process the order, then she should contact the customer to obtain that information. When contacting
the customer, Sasha should indicate why the order is incomplete and what information is needed to
process the order. If Sasha was to select and ship products based on the colors available in inventory or
was to ship one of each color available, the customer may not get what s/he wants, and send the
products back, which is costly to the business.

Streamline communication between buyers and sellers. Electronic data interchange (EDI) systems allow
businesses to use their computers to send information to another business's computers. Businesses use
an EDI system to monitor inventory and order products. EDI systems reduce paperwork and streamline
communication, which result in better channel efficiency. EDI systems do not always provide buyers with
a greater selection of products, nor do they ensure that product quality standards are achieved.
Businesses use global positioning systems (GPS) to track the shipments.

 5. C
Discourage innovation. A slotting allowance (fee) is a cash premium that manufacturers pay to
businesses to cover the costs involved in carrying a new product. Because larger manufacturers tend to
have more money than small manufacturers, they are often awarded shelf space for new products
because they can afford to pay higher slotting allowances. Consequently, this limits the small
manufacturers' exposure in the marketplace and their ability to effectively compete in the marketplace.
When small manufacturers believe that that they cannot compete, they are less likely to act on new
product ideas. When fewer products are on the market, customers have fewer choices. Tariffs are taxes
on imports and are levied by governments. Slotting allowances do not always decrease channel
reliability.

Purchase higher quantities of the sale items in a timely manner. Channel management is the process by
which marketers ensure that products are distributed to customers efficiently and effectively.
Coordinating channel management with other marketing activities is important because the store must
have items available to sell to the customers. This involves ordering the appropriate amount of items and
ensuring that the items are delivered to the store before the promotional event or sale. Stores that
promote goods they do not have in stock often annoy the customers who want to buy the items. A
selective distribution strategy is a distribution pattern in which a producer sells a product through a limited
number of intermediaries in a geographic location. An intensive distribution strategy involves a producer
selling a product through every available intermediary. A business would not change its overall
distribution strategy for a single promotional event. Hiring additional warehouse staff and sending copies
of promotional literature to vendors will not ensure that the store has enough products available to meet
the demand for the items during the sale.

Scrambled merchandising. Horizontal channel conflict occurs among channel members at the same level
(e.g., retailers). Scrambled merchandising is a situation in which intermediaries add products lines to their
product mix that were traditionally sold by other businesses, thereby creating a more competitive
environment. For example, many pharmacy chains are adding perishable food items (milk, eggs) to their
product lines. By doing so, they are now competing with grocery and convenience stores for scarce
customer dollars, which creates horizontal conflict. Chargebacks (penalties), direct selling (bypassing
intermediaries), and franchisor restrictions on franchisees often create vertical conflict among channel
members. Vertical conflict occurs among channel members at different levels in a distribution channel.

Taking steps to minimize barriers. Active listening involves the use of nonverbal cues, paraphrasing,
questioning, and other techniques to let a speaker know that a message has been heard and
understood. Barriers such as telephone calls, loud music, and other noises can hinder the ability to focus
on what the speaker is saying. Taking steps to minimize barriers, such as closing a door, or letting a
phone call go to voice mail can decrease distractions and improve active listening. Active listeners wait
until a speaker has finished talking before asking questions. Interrupting the speaker is rude and
distracting. If the listener pays attention only to the points s/he wants to hear, the message may be
misunderstood.

letters should contain contact information—the inquirer's name, telephone number, mailing address,

Use touch points to create positive customer experiences. The brand promise is a company's agreement
(spoken or unspoken) with customers that it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its
brand characteristics and values. To build and maintain customer relationships, a company's brand
promise should strive to create positive experiences for customers—experiences that will encourage
them to return to the business again and again. Companies use various touch points to create these
experiences for their customers. Touch points are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect
with its customers and reinforce its brand value. Touch points may include the company's employees,
product attributes and packaging, and technological systems (e.g., telephone, web site). A slogan (tag
line) is a phrase that is easy to remember, such as "Nationwide is on your side." A trade character is a
symbol that is personified (e.g., Tony the Tiger). Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as
elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may
confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition. One reason that businesses establish certain
types of policies (e.g., sales, service) is to ensure that customers are treated fairly. Establishing different
policies for different customers is not treating customers fairly, and in circumstances, these actions are
illegal.

Instant messaging. Instant messaging software allows two or more people to communicate in real time by
typing text into computers. Many online businesses use instant messaging as an element of the customer
service that they provide their customers. For example, a customer can type a question into a text field
on the business's web site, and the business's customer-service representative can respond immediately
to the question by posting a reply message. Having this form of technology helps businesses manage
their customer relationships in an efficient, positive way. A database is computerized storage for
information and facts. Procurement software helps businesses obtain and manage inventory. Calltracking
software helps businesses monitor their telephone calls.

Increase revenues. By expanding operations in foreign countries, businesses have the opportunity to sell
goods and services in another market. If the market buys the business's products, the business
increases both its market share and its revenues. Foreign expansion doesn't eliminate the business's tax
responsibility. A business exists to make a profit, so its primary goal is to earn money to keep operating.

the businesses must focus on generating revenues, so they are around to promote environmental issues

Wage regulations. Many external factors can affect the business environment. Laws that govern what
businesses can and cannot do are legal factors. Wage regulations require businesses to follow certain
laws in relation to the ways in which employees are compensated. For example, minimum-wage laws set
the lowest amount of hourly wages that a business may pay its employees. Minimum-wage regulations
are designed to protect employees from unfair treatment by businesses. If businesses fail to follow wageregulations,
the government is likely to penalize them. Market trends are social factors that affect the
business environment. International tensions are political factors that affect the business environment.
Interest rates are economic factors that affect the business environment.

The government implements expansionary monetary policies. Government monetary policies involve
making decisions about the amount of money that will be in circulation and the level of interest rates. The
government considers the state of the economy when determining in what ways, if any, it should change
monetary policies. If trends indicate a recession is or may occur, the government will implement
strategies to prevent the recession or to jumpstart the economy during a recession. To jumpstart the
economy, the government might lower interest rates and/or expand the money supply. Lowering interest
rates often stimulates borrowing and having more money in circulation often encourages consumer
spending. As unemployment increases, consumer spending decreases. Businesses tend to purchase
fewer raw materials when production decreases or when the resources (e.g., money, natural, human) are
not available. Consumer spending increases when consumers feel confident about the economy and
decreases when confidence levels in the economy fall.

Apply their talents where they are best used. People who use their talents are more likely to succeed in

weaknesses. For example, a very artistic person is probably going to be happier and more successful as
a graphic artist than if s/he were to work as an accountant, which involves working with a lot of numerical
data. While it is important for people to try to improve weaknesses (e.g., procrastination), this does not
mean that they change their personalities. Improving relationships with friends is a personal goal rather
than one that will help a person succeed in his/her career. Everyone experiences conflict at some time,

More advancement opportunities. Initiative is the willingness to act without having to be told to do so.
People who demonstrate initiative are willing to accept and seek out additional or even unpleasant duties.
Employers notice employees who demonstrate initiative because employees who take initiative can
positively impact the business. Employees who take initiative often benefit because employers are more
likely to promote these individuals and provide them with more job responsibilities, which can help them
advance in their careers. Employees who demonstrate initiative often receive higher ratings on their job
performance reviews. Having higher job-performance ratings does not mean that the employee will have
fewer performance reviews. Demonstrating initiative on the job does not always increase an employee's

other person, and emphasize those points during the negotiation. If the other person believes that the
businessperson wants to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, a win-win outcome is more likely to
occur. If each party agreed on every point, there would be no conflict to begin with, and no need for
negotiation. Embracing an all or nothing attitude and adopting an aggressive negotiating style tends to

to others, the owner has a right to expect payment (rent) from the renter. A lending investment involves
letting someone borrow your money for a specific timeframe for a certain price. Savings accounts, bonds,

Has cash available to use. The cash conversion cycle is the ratio that reflects the number of days
between a company paying for raw materials and receiving cash from selling the products made from

unavailable for other uses. Therefore, a financial manager strives to keep the cash conversion cycle as
short as possible, so that the business has more free cash to work with. A dividend is the amount of
money that a corporation pays to a stockholder as earnings on an investment. The profit margin is a

which can help the business become more profitable. Overtime for hourly employees is one

information and using it for marketing purposes or providing it to other businesses, it is engaging in
unethical behavior. To be ethical, the business should disclose to web-site visitors and customers that
they collect this information and how they intend to use it. Then, customers have an opportunity to decide
if they want to reveal personal information. It is ethical business behavior to obtain a customer's personal
data, if the business has the customer's consent. Implementing fair and well-communicated opt-in and

A marketer tells a customer that s/he is conducting research, and then begins a sales pitch. SUGGING is
an acronym for “selling under the guise of research.” SUGGING is an unethical practice in which a
marketer pretends to conduct research, but, in fact, is really attempting to sell a good or service to a
consumer. SUGGING is deceptive and rarely facilitates a long-term selling relationship. It also harms the
integrity of the general marketing-research field because potential respondents who have been subjected
to SUGGING are less likely to trust researchers and are likely to question their true motives. A
telemarketer who asks a person if s/he knows anyone who might buy a certain product is trying to obtain
a referral. Sending samples to consumers is a promotional technique. A salesperson providing a
customer the opportunity to try a product for a certain period of time is implementing a strategy to make a
sale.

customer-service issues, lack of promotion, lack of salesperson knowledge, product quality, etc. After the
business decides to conduct exploratory research, it can determine the types of primary and/or
secondary information that it needs, which may include formatting any necessary surveys and developing
a framework for sampling.

use to select the participants. Researchers determine the validity of the data after coding and analyzing
it, which can only occur after the sample group has been selected and surveyed. Researchers usually
assign response codes during the survey-development process. Predicting the sample group's
responses is not a necessary action to take when a business develops a sampling plan.

customers' buying habits and inventory status because the scanning system can track large volumes of
goods. Once enough data are collected, researchers evaluate the data to determine how fast or slow

the research process and identify appropriate methods to use to obtain the desired information. The

Recording. Errors can occur at any stage during the marketing-research process. When a researcher

Simple words without jargon. Wording is an important consideration when developing a survey. To obtain
objective, honest answers, respondents must be able to understand the questions. This requires the use
of simple and clear (not vague) wording so respondents are not confused when they read the questions.
Jargon is technical language, which may confuse respondents. Surveys should not contain words with
dual meanings because these words may confuse respondents, too.

Discussion relevance. A focus group is a group that gathers to discuss a specific topic. Businesses often
hold focus groups to obtain marketing information about their goods and services. When a business
holds a focus group, it is collecting marketing information about a specific topic, which makes it primary
research data for the business. Because the business is collecting the information for a specific purpose,
the data are relevant to the business. Weaknesses or disadvantages for businesses that hold focus
groups are that they can be expensive and can take a lot of time to prepare for. And, sometimes, the
focus-group moderator projects a bias, which hurts the objectivity of the research.

A company that uses out-of-date research data may make poor business decisions. For example,
suppose a business obtains older research stating that a large segment of the market wants product X.
The business develops and markets product X, but the good or service doesn't sell because
circumstances in the marketplace have changed. The business stands to lose a lot of money because it
did not use current research data to make its decision to proceed with producing and marketing product
X. Information may be timely or up-to-date, but it doesn't always relate to the business's problem or
situation at hand. Information that a business obtains from online sources is not always accurate or
correct. Older Information that is obtained from secondary sources may be credible, if circumstances
have not changed.

Internet survey. A survey is a marketing-research method that involves asking customers questions to
learn their opinions and the reasons behind those opinions. For example, a business might obtain
marketing information from its customers because it wants to determine their levels of satisfaction during
their last encounters with the business. The business might e-mail a short, easy survey to its customers
within 24 hours of their last business encounter. Because the survey is short and the encounter is fresh in
the customer's mind, the customer is more likely to respond to the survey. The Internet is a quick, easy,
cost-effective method for collecting this type of information. Face-to-face interviews and test marketing,
which are types of field experiments, are often expensive, time-consuming methods for collecting
marketing information.

Pricing. Marketing functions are interrelated activities that work together to get goods and services from
producers to consumers. Pricing is the marketing function that involves determining and adjusting prices
to maximize return and meet customers' perceptions of value. If customers believe that the product's
value is worth the price, then the product is likely to sell well. If the product sells well, then the business
earns revenue and a profit. Promotion is a marketing function that communicates information about
goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome. Product/Service management is the
marketing function that involves obtaining, developing, maintaining, and improving a product or service
mix in response to market opportunities. Channel management is the marketing function that involves the
processes by which marketers ensure that products are distributed to customers efficiently and
effectively.

Product. The marketing mix is made up of a distinct blend of marketing elements—product, place,
promotion, and price. The business must first determine the products that it wants to sell, which may
include specific brands and support services (e.g., warranties, maintenance). Price is the marketing-mix
element that involves determining the amount of money to ask in exchange for the business's products.
The place element of the marketing mix focuses on the distribution of the products—getting the product
to the right place at the right time. The promotion element of the marketing mix involves the use of
various forms of communication to inform, persuade, or remind customers about the business's goods
and services.

Demographics. Demographics are the physical and social characteristics of the population. A business
that segments the market on the basis of demographics considers factors such as the age, gender, and
ethnicity of the population. Psychographic segmentation is the division of a market on the basis of
consumers' lifestyles and personalities, which are influenced by their behavior. Geographic segmentation
involves dividing a market on the basis of location (e.g., zip code).

SWOT analysis. A marketing plan is a set of procedures or strategies for attracting the target customer to
a business. A component of the marketing plan is the SWOT analysis, which describes the businesses
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Because Maria is describing one of her business's
strengths (highly creative and flexible staff) and one of her business's weaknesses (lack of financial
resources), she is working on the SWOT analysis. The promotional plan is the set of procedures or
strategies for the business's promotional efforts. The marketing mix is the four elements of marketing—
product, place, promotion, and price. A financial statement is a summary of accounting information.

Rising inflation rate. A situation analysis is a determination of a company's current business situation and
the direction in which the company is headed. When a company conducts a situation analysis, it
evaluates many internal and external factors. Some external factors that a company evaluates are the
economic indicators that affect the overall health of the economy, such as the interest rates, the
unemployment rate, and the inflation rate. Inflation is the rapid rise in prices. Rising inflation is a threat to
a company because customers have less money to spend on the company's products, which can
negatively impact its sales. In addition, the company may also need to spend more money for raw
materials, which can lower the company's profitability. When interest rates fall, customers are more likely
to use credit or obtain loans to purchase goods and services, which may benefit the company. Likewise,
an increase in GDP and a decline in unemployment indicate a strong economy in which customers are
spending their money, which may positively impact on the company's sales.

than one user to access a particular program at one time has multi-user capabilities. An operating system
that allows several central processing units (computers) to access a single program has multiprocessing
capabilities. Multithreading capabilities allow different components of one computer program to run at the

Establishing efficient processes. Operations management is the process of planning, controlling, and
monitoring the day-to-day activities required for continued business function. To keep the business
running smoothly and effectively, the operations function makes sure that employees are ordering goods
for resale or manufacturing and developing quality goods and services in the most efficient ways
possible. To work efficiently, the operations function establishes processes or steps to help improve
productivity and reduce waste. Locating potential customers is a marketing activity. Providing access to

Discourages attempted burglaries. When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several
locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt a break-in because they will be video-taped or
photographed by the cameras. And when the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are
more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or
robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures
to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems.
Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors,
which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need
for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and is considered a nonviolent form of deception (white-collar
crime).

Tangible resources are those that can be touched, smelled, tasted, seen, or heard. Office supplies,
computers, steel, and signage are tangible items because they can be seen and touched. Perishable
goods (e.g., various foods) are items that are capable of spoiling, decaying and dying. Donated
resources are contributed or given by others. There is not enough information to determine if the goods in

Order accuracy. Businesses evaluate their vendors' strengths and weaknesses to determine if changes
should be made. One factor that businesses evaluate is the accuracy of a vendor's orders. If the vendor
consistently sends incorrect items, the business can work with the vendor to correct the problems, or it
can decide to terminate the relationship with the vendor. Other considerations might include invoice
accuracy, order lead-time, and delivery time. The business does not usually evaluate the vendor's
business plan, invoice numbers, or accounting methods.

Identify and check your assumptions. An assumption is a thought or idea that you presume (take for
granted) is true. In some situations, a person makes incorrect assumptions. For example, a supervisor
may assume that an employee has completed a task by the deadline. The supervisor makes this
assumption because the employee has completed tasks by the given deadlines in the past. The
supervisor's assumption is based on his/her experience. However, the employee experienced a
computer problem, which prevented her/him from completing the task by deadline. So in this particular
situation, the supervisor's assumption was incorrect. Therefore, when you are solving problems, it is
important to make sure that you have all of the correct information available and that you look at
situations and issues objectively. After collecting all of the necessary information and checking
assumptions, you can brainstorm solutions and determine the best solution to implement. The nature of
the problem depends on whether or not you need to ask for input from your peers.

Poor image. Price gouging is a pricing practice that involves raising prices above market value when
demand is high, and no alternative is available to consumers. A business that temporarily increases
prices for goods (e.g., lumber, milk, medicine) during a crisis is behaving in an unethical and, in many
jurisdictions, an illegal manner. When a business engages in price gouging activities, it runs the risk of
losing credibility with the public, which can result in a poor image or damaged reputation. When a
business has a poor public image, its customers often begin to buy products from the business's
competitors, which can reduce the business's sales and profits.

Cardholders receive better discounts on certain products than non-cardholders. Many businesses (e.g.,
grocers) have implemented frequent-shopper programs to encourage repeat sales and build customer
loyalty. Many businesses use a computer-coded card that the customer or cashier scans at the point-ofsale.
This provides the cardholder with special or better discounts than non-cardholders; therefore, the
prices that cardholders pay for many products are less than the prices that non-cardholders pay. Noncardholders
are not charged service fees to obtain lower prices. Some frequent-shopper programs often
use reward points or a combination of reward points and price discounts for cardholders. Frequentshopper
cards are an incentive for customers to continue buying from the business offering the program
rather than its competitors.

Scanner fraud. Some pricing errors in business computer systems are honest mistakes. There are,
however, businesses that do not change the original prices to sale prices in their computers on purpose,
hoping that customers will not notice at checkout. This activity is scanner fraud, and it is a deceptive
advertising practice. Many governments have regulations in place to protect consumers against this
deceptive practice. Price discrimination is an illegal activity in which a business charges different
customers different prices for similar amounts and types of products. Collusion (price fixing) is an illegal
business agreement in which businesses agree on prices of their goods or services, resulting in little
choice for the consumer. Dumping is a practice that involves selling products for lower prices in foreign
markets. Many countries have anti-dumping regulations.

Maturity. The product life cycle is the stages through which goods and services move from the time they
are introduced on the market until they are taken off the market. When a product reaches its maturity
stage, it has been in the market for a while. During this stage, sales tend to peak, and then increase at a
slower rate or start to decline. Because sales tend to slow, the business is likely to price the product to
maintain market share—it might even need to reduce the price. By reducing the price, the business's
profit margins tend to narrow. If the business maintains the product's pricing, and sales start to slow or
decline, the profit margins will also narrow. During the introduction stage of the product's life cycle, the
business may not make any profit because it is trying to recoup its research and development costs.
During the growth stage, the business is likely to see profits increase and peak. During the decline stage,
profit margins are likely to start declining rapidly.

Demographic changes. A product opportunity is a favorable circumstance that presents itself to provide a
good or service that people are willing to buy. Individuals often discover product opportunities by simply
being aware of changes that are occurring around them. Demographics are the physical and social
characteristics of the population. Age is a demographic characteristic of the population or market
segment. As a segment of the population ages, its wants and needs change. When an individual
recognizes physical and social changes, s/he has identified a product opportunity due to demographic
shifts. Personal attitudes are psychographic factors. Psychographics are a market segment's shared
attitudes, opinions, and values. Geographic limitations relate to a specific location or region such as
hilliness or a lack of water. Economic resources are the human and natural resources and capital goods
used to produce goods and services.

Customers are less likely to buy the individual items from competitors later. Product bundling involves
combining two or more products and selling them for a single price. The selling price of the bundled
products is set lower than the total price of the items if they were purchased separately. One advantage
of bundling products is that the low price of multiple items often encourages customers to buy now. Even
if the customers do not use all of the products right away, they can put them away and use them later
when needed. Because the customers have the products in hand, they won't need to go out later—to a
competitor—to purchase the product. Customers are not always satisfied with every item in a product
bundle. Bundled products are not always discounted and do not always increase the business's profit
margins. Product bundling does not always reduce a business's cash-flow problems.

Competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is the edge achieved by a business that offers something
better than its competitors. For example, one business might create a competitive advantage by
providing a service that its competitors do not, such as same-day delivery or free installation. Another
business might have a competitive advantage if it offers a product made with high-quality (superior)
materials or rare resources. To create a competitive advantage, the business must communicate these
unique attributes or benefits to customers. Touch points are all of the opportunities that a business has to
connect with customers and reinforce its brand value. Touch points include the business's employees,
web site, advertising, facilities, etc. If used appropriately, touch points can create a competitive
advantage. Time utility is the usefulness created when products are made available at the time they are
needed or wanted by customers.

connect with customers and reinforce its brand. Some opportunities that the business has to
communicate and reinforce the corporate brand are through the company's web site and during sales

Points of difference. Positioning refers to the ways in which a business creates a certain image or
impression of itself in the minds of customers. A company evaluates many factors when it positions
itself—its target market, its products, and its competitors. By evaluating its competitors, the company can
determine ways in which it differs from other companies that provide similar products. By doing so, the
business is determining its points of difference with other businesses. By knowing these points of
difference, which include the competitors' strengths and weaknesses as well as its own, the business can
determine how to set itself apart from the competition. Then, the business can use this information to
position itself by emphasizing its uniqueness in comparison to its competitors. Profit margins, managerial
styles, and support services might be points of difference.

Fear-based. Fear-based advertising involves communicating nonpersonal promotional messages in ways
that scare buyers into thinking that they need to purchase a product to stay healthy or safe. Many
consumers, businesses, and government agencies believe that this type of emotional appeal is unethical
behavior. Stereotyping is a set image or an assumption about a person or thing. Gender (male or female)
bias is an opinion or judgment based on feelings about gender rather than fact. Puffery involves
exaggerating a product's characteristics, benefits, or capabilities.

Media-rich advertising. As the growth of e-commerce continues, many businesses are increasing their
use of Internet advertising to communicate promotional information. Media-rich advertisements use
animation, sound, and video to send interactive promotional messages. Blogs are online diaries.
Interstitials are Internet ads that appear on the computer screen between web-site page changes. Banner
ads are Internet ads that appear across the middle, top, side, or bottom of a computer screen when the
Internet user accesses a web page.

Telemarketing. Telemarketing is an advertising medium that utilizes telephone service to promote a
product either by phoning prospective customers or providing a number for them to call. In the past few
years, consumer groups have complained that telemarketing has become intrusive, so many
governments have started to regulate telemarketing practices. Some governments have developed “do
not call” laws. These laws allow consumers to register their phone numbers with a “do not call” registry.
Qualifying businesses must obtain this list and not call consumers who have registered with the program.
If they violate these laws, the businesses may be fined. “Do not call” laws do not regulate contests,
Internet downloads, or direct mail.

Providing information to activists to share with others. Word-of-mouth promotion involves customers who
tell others about their satisfaction with the business. Amplified word-of-mouth promotion involves the use
of proactive efforts (campaigns) in which the business provides specific information to customers
(activists) to pass along to their friends, family, and business contacts. On the other hand, organic wordof-mouth
promotion occurs naturally. Because customers are satisfied with the business and its products,
they tell others about this satisfaction in the course of normal conversation. For example, if a business
shows a sincere interest in the customer by asking for feedback, taking actions to ensure customer
loyalty, or improving products, the customer is likely to share those positive experiences with others.

Are sent to those who are mostly likely to buy. Direct marketing is an effort to obtain business by sending
promotional information to customers directly in their businesses or homes. Primary direct marketing
channels include postal mail, telephone, and electronic mail. The advantage to direct marketing is that
the business can send promotional messages to the people who are most likely to buy their goods and
services. This can save the business time and money because it is not wasting its resources by sending
promotional information to people who would not buy its products. Direct marketing does not always
enhance a business's credibility. In fact, a business that sends too many direct marketing messages may
turn off a customer, thereby reducing the business's credibility. Some direct marketing materials can be
very expensive to produce and mail to customers, which is a clear disadvantage of direct marketing.
Direct marketing does not always provide customers with direct access to knowledgeable salespeople.

Rebate. Sales-promotion techniques are activities other than advertising, selling, and personal selling
that stimulate customer purchases. A rebate is a sales-promotion technique in which a business
(manufacturer) returns part of the price that a customer (Ben) pays for a good (cellular telephone) or
service. Rebates stimulate sales because customers want to receive money back for their purchases.
Couponing involves the use of printed certificates that entitle the holder to a reduced purchase price.
Coupons are generally processed at the point of sale. Sweepstakes involve a game of chance in which a
customer wins a prize. A warranty is a promise made by the seller to the customer that the seller will
repair or replace a product that does not perform as expected. A warranty is a benefit of purchase rather
than a sales-promotion technique.

Newsletters, annual reports, and the company's web site. Public relations involves establishing good
relationships between the business and the public. A business tries to maintain positive relationships with
different groups that make up the public, such as employees, local businesses, government officials, the
media, and the business's shareholders. Because the shareholders are the owners of the company, it is
important to develop and maintain positive relationships with them. The public-relations department does
this by communicating with them through newsletters, annual reports, the company's web site, and online
social networks. Print advertisements and commercials are forms of nonpersonal advertising. Businesses
use press releases and news conferences to convey information to the media. Policy manuals help guide
employees' actions on the job. Consumer blogs can be developed by anyone to communicate positive
and negative information about various goods and services. A sponsorship is a partnership in which a
company pays a fee to affiliate itself with a team, league, or event.

 86. A
Coordinate the advertisement's elements. To maximize an advertisement's impact, the four main
elements of an advertisement should be coordinated. The advertisement's headline, illustration, copy,
and signature should attract the reader's attention in a balanced, visually attractive, and clear way. The
advertisement's elements should relate to one another to convey the ad's theme and reinforce the
message. The font, amount of text and graphics, and the use of celebrity testimonials vary and depend
on the ad's theme, the intended message, and the designer's style. Celebrities are in the news for both
good and bad reasons. Insufficient information is provided to determine whether the business would want
its brand associated with the celebrity. The use of a variety of fonts is not recommended since they
detract from the advertisement's message.

Jana prepares a press release about her firm's new licensing agreement with a large company. The
public-relations department is the area of the business that is responsible for establishing good relations
between the business and the public. Public-relations staff members are responsible for developing and
distributing press releases. Press releases include newsworthy information about the business and are
provided to the media to obtain publicity. Businesses often distribute press releases to announce new
products, employee promotions, mergers, awards, licensing agreements, etc. Sales promotion is a
product-promotion activity. Calling on prospective customers to schedule product demonstrations is a
sales activity. Reviewing an overdue-accounts report is an accounting activity.

Developing an employee newsletter. A business's public-relations efforts involve creating and
maintaining goodwill between the business and the public. There are often many subgroups of the public
with whom the business wants to maintain good relations, such as the customers, shareholders, local
residents, community organizations, local businesses, local residents, and the business's own
employees. The business's employees are part of the business's internal audience. Maintaining positive
relationships with employees is important because employees are often customers who buy the
business's products. They also talk to their friends and family about the business and its products.
Therefore, it is important for a business's public-relations department to develop and implement publicrelations
activities that affect its employees. One activity that the public-relations staff members are often
responsible for is developing the employee newsletter. The newsletter updates the employees about new
products, community events, employee promotions, awards, etc. Press conferences, press releases, and
charity donations are activities that involve informing the business's external audiences about the
business's activities.

Holding product demonstrations. A trade show is an event where businesses communicate information
about products to build sales leads and interest. Trade-show participation is a way for businesses to
communicate with the individuals or businesses most likely to buy the business's products. When a
business's salesperson demonstrates the product, trade-show attendees see the product's attributes and
how it works. In some demonstrations, the show attendees often have an opportunity to try the product
themselves. Businesses send direct mail to their customers' homes and businesses. A billboard is a form
of outdoor advertising. Direct mail and billboards are not the most appropriate ways to communicate at a
trade show. A contest is a sales promotion activity that offers a prize or award. Holding a contest, rather
than developing one, is a good way to draw attendees to a trade-show booth, so the business can
communicate information about its products.

Number of expected visitors. Trade shows are events where businesses display and/or demonstrate their
products to build sales leads and interest. A business considers many factors when deciding to
participate in a particular trade show. Some factors that businesses consider are the trade-show location,
travel and hotel expenses, booth costs, target audience, and the number of expected visitors. If the
number of expected visitors is low and the show takes place in a distant location, the costs of
participation may not be feasible. Operating policies, inventory levels, and the costs of buying food at
concession stands are not primary factors that a business considers when deciding if it should participate
in a trade show.

Budget. The promotional plan is the framework for the promotional activities of a business. An important
element of the promotional plan is the budget. A budget is an estimate of what income and expenses will
be for a specific timeframe or for a specific project. A budget is an important tool that helps a business
allocate money and monitor spending. The executive summary is an overview of the plan. The strategy
section of the promotional plan provides information about the specific activities that the business will use
to accomplish its promotional goals. A situation analysis is a determination of a firm's current business
situation and the direction in which the business is headed.

Offering training programs and providing technical support. Providing quality customer service after the
sale helps to reinforce the customer's buying decision and often leads to repeat sales. Offering training
programs and providing technical support are two ways in which a business can provide customer
service after the sale. Arranging financing, suggestion selling, providing product information, checking
inventory, and advertising are actions that businesses take before the sales transaction occurs.
Generating referrals is a way for salespeople to increase their clientele rather than providing customer
service after the sale.

Ensure that all customers are treated fairly. Selling policies are the general rules established by
management to guide the personal selling effort and outline how things must be done. Selling policies are
beneficial to customers because they ensure that all customers receive fair and equitable treatment.
Although some businesses offer credit options, not all businesses do. If credit requirements are too rigid,
then they are not beneficial to many customers. A disadvantage to salespeople of selling policies occurs
when the policies are rigid and inflexible, which can restrict the salesperson's authority, which in turn can
negatively affect a customer's experience with the business. Selling policies that maximize profitability
and help achieve sales goals are advantages to the business rather than to the customers.

 94. C
Entertainment guidelines. During the selling process, salespeople often encounter situations that are not
clearly right or wrong. Salespeople tend to judge these situations differently—according to their personal
code of ethics. One of the "questionable" situations that salespeople might encounter involves
entertaining customers. While some businesses view entertainment as a way to build positive customer
relationships, others view it as favoritism or bribery. By developing entertainment guidelines for their
salespeople, businesses can clearly communicate acceptable and unacceptable entertainment activities.
A promotional budget is a forecast of the money that the business plans to spend on promoting its goods
and services during a certain timeframe. Diversity training manuals are designed to help employees
understand diversity issues in the workplace. Product delivery policies are the business's guidelines for
delivering products to its customers.

Review the prospective client's web site. Salespeople can learn a lot about their prospective clients by
reviewing their web sites. Salespeople can obtain historical data about the business, find information
about the products it offers, determine its target market, and its business philosophy. This type of
information helps salespeople prepare presentations that will appeal to the business. The prospective
clients' vendors and employees may not be willing to share information with salespeople. Because the
Intranet is the business's internal computer network, the salesperson is not likely to obtain access to it.

Misrepresentation. By omitting important facts about a product, the business is misrepresenting the
product and misleading consumers, which is illegal in many countries. Businesses that misrepresent their
products often face lawsuits and fines. When a business overstates the capabilities of a product, it is
exaggeration. Branding is the process of creating certain images about a product or business in the
minds of consumers. In a sponsorship agreement, exclusivity is the sponsor's privilege of being the only
company in its particular category of goods or services.

The manufacturer's product literature. The most reliable source of information about a new product
comes from the manufacturer. A salesperson can obtain accurate warranty information, product
specifications, and operating instructions from the manufacturer's web site or printed materials. Branson's
advertisement and the display model may not contain information about the product's warranty.
Salespeople might contact customers who already own the product to find out how the customers like or
use the product, but they wouldn't contact customers to obtain warranty information.

Putting the customer at ease. To sell effectively, the salesperson must first take steps to put the customer
at ease. Offering prompt assistance and being friendly and approachable are ways in which the
salesperson can make the customer feel comfortable to discuss his/her product needs. After putting the
customer at ease, the salesperson can determine the customer's needs, recommend a product, describe
the product's benefits, and ask for the sale. Complementary items are goods that go with the primary
product. A salesperson would recommend complementary items after the customer makes the decision
to buy the primary product.

Esteem. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory states that motivation is related to five levels of needs. The
basic needs must first be met before a person is motivated to fulfill the next level of needs. Physiological
needs are the first level and involve obtaining the most basic needs—food, shelter, and clothing. The
next level involves meeting safety needs. Esteem needs, which are the level of needs after social needs,
involve obtaining goods and services that provide the buyer with status and recognition. For example,
esteem needs motivate a person to buy a designer handbag or sports car. Self-actualization needs are
related to a person's self-development and desire to accomplish a goal or meet a challenge.

First-line. First-line or supervisory managers work directly with the employees who carry out the
business's routine work. First-line managers report to the mid-level managers. Mid-level managers are
responsible for implementing the goals set by executive (top-level) managers, and are the link between
supervisory and executive (top-level) managers. Mid-level managers report to the executive managers.
Executive managers are responsible for the whole organization and spend most of their time setting
organizational goals and conducting strategic planning. A regional manager manages employees in a
specific location or region. Regional managers are usually considered mid-level managers.
