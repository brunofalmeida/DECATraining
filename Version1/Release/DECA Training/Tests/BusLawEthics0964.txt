Age requirement. In certain situations, businesses are legally allowed to establish age requirements for some jobs. One of
these jobs is driving delivery vehicles because there are laws that specify at what age a person is legally allowed to obtain
a driver's license. Therefore, a business has the right to advertise for employees to drive who are over a certain age, such
as 16 or 18. However, businesses do not have the right to establish unequal compensation plans for new employees who
perform the same jobs. Businesses may not discriminate on the basis of gender or nationality when hiring new employees.

Tort. A tort is a private wrongdoing against another entity. A person who commits a wrongdoing against society is guilty of
a crime. Punishments for crimes and punishments for torts are different. A defendant who is guilty of a crime receives
his/her punishment in a variety of ways, which might include serving a prison sentence and/or probation, conducting
community service, paying government fines, or performing a combination of these options. Tort punishments usually
involve paying monetary compensation to the plaintiff or stopping the activities that violate the plaintiff's rights. Contracts
are covered under tort law. Liability refers to the debt that an individual or business owes to another entity. Liability is not a
form of law.

Variation in litigation procedures. Litigation procedures refer to the step­by­step process all parties follow in regard to a
legal dispute or initiative. Because each country has different political, legal, and court systems, each country has a
different approach to resolving legal problems. These differences are often problematic for multinational corporations that
do business in many countries. A country's judicial system does not always publish judicial opinions. Fluctuating currency
values are normal in the world economy and, therefore, are not primary legal issues for multinational corporations. Natural
and human resource availability is an economic issue, rather than a legal issue.

A business's rules for its employees. Private laws are regulations that apply between two individuals or groups. There are
many sources that develop private regulation. For example, industries and professions develop performance standards
that they follow. Another source of private law includes the businesses that develop policies to maintain a fair and orderly
atmosphere in the workplace. These types of rules might address issues such as proper workplace attire and the use of
office equipment for personal purposes. The zoning of land, speed limits, and income tax rates are examples of public
laws.

Judge. The judge is the person who makes sure that everyone who is involved in the case follows the appropriate
procedures during the course of the trial. The jury decides the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The petitioner is the
plaintiff, or the person who initiates the lawsuit. The prosecutor is the plaintiff, usually the government, in a criminal trial.

Preponderance of evidence. A crime is a wrongdoing against society. To begin a criminal trial, the plaintiff (government)
must have sufficient proof that the defendant committed the crime. This proof is called the preponderance of evidence.
Before deliberating, the judge instructs jurors to determine the defendant's guilt or innocence "beyond reasonable doubt"
by considering the evidence presented during the trial. Due process refers to a person's right to be heard in court. Doctrine
of negligence is not a legal term.

Concurrent jurisdiction. Jurisdiction refers to the authority that a court has to resolve a legal issue. A court's jurisdiction is
determined by factors such as subject matter and physical location. In a few cases, both state and federal courts have the
jurisdiction to hear a case. This occurs when certain laws do not provide the federal government with exclusive jurisdiction.
Bilateral litigation, dual authority, and indeterminate influence are not widely used terms that describe a court's jurisdiction.

11. A
Incidental. When a judge decides a lawsuit, s/he must determine the appropriate resolution within the legal boundaries.
There are several options for resolving contract disputes, and the resolution depends on a variety of circumstances. A
judge might award a plaintiff a monetary settlement for incidental damages to cover extra expenses that the plaintiff
experiences as a direct result of the breach of contract. A plaintiff collects incidental damages in addition to the
compensatory damages. When a plaintiff receives compensatory damages, the award amount puts the plaintiff in the
same position as before the contract breach. If one party does not perform activities that they agree upon in the contract,
the other party pays liquidated damages for those specific activities. Transactional is not a term widely used to describe a
contract resolution method or remedy.

Garnishment. To collect outstanding debt, it is possible for a party to legally seize a debtor's assets. Garnishment requires
that the debtor's employer withhold a certain amount of the debtor's wages. The withheld money is then distributed to the
appropriate party. Foreclosure involves obtaining the debtor's physical home, property, or business to pay debt.
Liquidation occurs when the debtor's assets are converted to cash in order to pay the debt. A dissolution nullifies a
contract between two parties.

Economics. Business laws are rules that govern activities that involve the production and distribution of goods and
services. Economics involve the study of economic activities—the production, consumption, exchange, and distribution of
goods and services. The purpose of business laws is to protect consumers and businesses from the unfair practices of
other businesses. Ergonomics involve the study of work environments. Physics involve the scientific study of matter and
movement. Psychographics involve the study of lifestyles and personalities.

Negligent. Tort laws address issues about private wrongdoings against individuals. When a person does intentional or
unintentional harm to another, the person is behaving in a careless or negligent manner, which violates the tort duty to
care. Systematic means orderly. A person who acts in a systematic, cautious, or sensible manner is not necessarily
violating his/her duty to care.

Yes, if the employee is performing his/her job at the time the accident occurred. A provision called the scope of
employment states that an employer can be held accountable or liable for an employee's actions while the employee is on
the job. A delivery person who is en route to make a delivery is on the job. If the employee causes an automobile accident,
the business can be held liable for damages (e.g., medical bills, repair bills) to the accident victim. If the employee is
running personal errands or taking a lunch break, the business is not necessarily liable for the accident. Employees are
not always expected to purchase personal liability insurance when they begin a new job.

Limits. In some cases, such as medical malpractice suits in various states, laws limit the amount of money a plaintiff can

Misuse of product. A manufacturer that sells a product in good faith and provides product use directions might challenge
the plaintiff's case by presenting evidence that s/he misused or abused the product, which resulted in product damage or
personal injury. Duress is a legal term that means exerting unreasonable pressure on someone to take a specific action.
When a person objects to imprisonment procedures and policies, s/he files a legal petition called habeas corpus with the
court. Circumstantial evidence is data that is difficult to verify beyond a reasonable doubt. Although circumstantial
evidence might be an element that a defendant presents in a product liability lawsuit, it is not a type of defense.

License to practice. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties stating that one party is to do something in
return for something provided by another party. Some professions require people to obtain a license to conduct certain
activities. Doctors, nurses, dentists, teachers, lawyers, architects, and electricians are examples of people who must
obtain a certain level of education and obtain a license to do their jobs. In many countries, it is illegal to engage in
professional activities without a valid license. Therefore, if a person enters a contract with a non­licensed professional, the
contract is not legal or binding. Titles, corporate certificates, and permit of intent are not legal documents that the
government requires professionals to have.

Agreement purpose is unlawful. A contract is a mutually beneficial agreement between two parties in which both parties
promise to perform certain activities. If the activities involve breaking laws, a court cannot enforce the contract if a breach
occurs. For example, a court is not going to enforce a contract in which a drug dealer breaches an agreement by failing to
pay his/her source for illegal substances. If an oral contract meets the criteria that make it valid, the court can legally
enforce it. Contracts do not need approval from a public registrar. Contracts are enforceable when the parties act with
reasonable care.

Workplace diversity. Affirmative action is an effort to give special employment consideration to disadvantaged groups.
Workplace diversity refers to all ways in which people differ, including background, age, gender, and race. Businesses
often benefit by employing different types of people with a variety of viewpoints and experiences. An affirmative action
program does not necessarily increase a business's sales tax liability, its workers' productivity, or its labor union's
membership. Many businesses do not employ workers who belong to a labor union.

is a written or verbal approval by a reputable external source. An autoresponder is a computer program that automatically

Intellectual. Intellectual property is the ideas that people develop that result in artistic works, inventions, or processes.
Originators protect their intellectual property by obtaining patents, trademarks, or copyrights from the appropriate
government agency. The rapid growth of the Internet and e­commerce makes it more difficult for owners to control the
unauthorized use of their intellectual property and to seek legal action or restitution when it is misused. Personal property
refers to something an individual owns. Residential property is land that contains homes or dwellings. Commercial
property is land that is used for business purposes.

The plaintiff and the defendant are often in physically distant locations. Online business transactions occur all over the
world by computer. Because of the Web's international reach, it is difficult to apply traditional law to cyberspace torts and
crimes because jurisdiction cannot be clearly defined—each state or country has different laws. Online dispute resolution
forums are a way to settle minor disagreements that occur in e­commerce. This is a good way to resolve issues in a
cost­efficient and timely manner because the plaintiff and defendant often live and work in physically distant locations. The
decisions rendered by the forums also provide precedent for cyber cases that traditional courts of law hear. Traditional
court systems do not refuse to handle cyber torts. Cyber crimes can be very serious and destructive. Geographic (e.g.,
different countries) rather than economic conditions are more likely to affect a trial's fairness.

The ability to electronically file documents with a court depends on case type and court jurisdiction. Technological
advancements, such as e­mail, have made it easy and efficient for attorneys to file necessary documents with the courts
at all levels. Because each court and jurisdiction has different procedural laws, the ability and acceptability of filing legal
documents by electronic means differs. In some jurisdictions, only certain types of cases and motions can be filed
electronically. All federal courts do not require attorneys to file legal documents electronically for all felony cases.

Protect small businesses from the predatory practices of large businesses. Antitrust laws are rules that protect the
marketplace from monopolistic situations and encourage fair competition among businesses. Predatory practices refer to
the aggressive and often unethical activities that a company uses to put a competitor out of business. Without antitrust
laws, many small businesses would be forced to shut down due to their inability to compete with larger businesses that
have access to more resources (e.g., money). The purpose of antitrust laws does not include controlling the production
and prices of nonessential goods and services, encouraging mergers and acquisitions, or restricting competition to
minimize fluctuations in the economy.

Recipe. Intellectual property is defined as a person's ideas or formulas, which are intangible by nature. These ideas or

Chicken. Inventory, equipment, and vehicles (e.g., automobiles) are examples of personal property. Personal property is

File a lawsuit against copyright infringers. A copyright refers to the legal protection of books and other artistic works
granted by the government and giving the creators sole rights to them for a certain period of time. To obtain a copyright in
the United States, a creator must file two copies of the work and register the work with the copyright office. If the
necessary paperwork is not filed, a creator cannot prove that s/he is the owner of the material. Therefore, the creator
cannot file a lawsuit against a person or business that uses or sells the material. A licensee legally buys the right to use
copyrighted material for a specific purpose or time. Therefore, the licensee is authorized to use the copyrighted material,
rather than unauthorized. A business cannot reproduce another business's trademarked material (e.g., symbols, designs)
unless the other business has granted permission to do so. A business that obtains a copyright for its material does not
limit its financial liability with its lenders.

The employer. A copyright is the legal protection of books and other artistic works that the government grants, and it gives

creates a work on the job, the employer owns the copyright. This situation is covered under the "made for hire" provision
and is part of the United States Copyright Act of 1976. Therefore, the employee, the printer, and the directors do not own
the brochure's copyright.

Commerce. A trademark is a symbol, design, or word used by a producer to identify a good or service and distinguish the

used for commerce (business) activities. Trademarks are often used in conjunction with manufacturers, in advertising
materials, and production processes, which are all business­related activities.

A business can register a trademark for future use but the mark must be used within a certain time. A trademark is a word,
name, symbol, or device used by a business to identify and distinguish its products from the products of other businesses.
To register for government trademark protection, there are certain criteria that the business must meet. The basic
requirement for a trademark is that it is must be used for commerce purposes. A business can register for trademark
protection for a trademark that is not currently in use, but it must be in use within a certain time. The government does not
limit the number of trademarks for which a business can apply. Trademarks do not need to be in use for a year before a
business can apply for registration protection with the government. A business does not need to be a corporation to apply
for trademark protection.

Ethics govern an individual's behavior, and laws provide guidance for acceptable group behavior. Ethics are the basic
principles that govern an individual's own behavior. Laws are rules that govern a specific group's behavior and provide
consistency and order within the group. Laws are often based on ethical principles that are agreed upon by members of a
group or society. However, a person's personal ethics do not always agree with some laws (e.g., death penalty). A
person's ethical behavior can be influenced by several factors (e.g., parents, education, and society). Laws differ from
country to country and are influenced by cultural factors. Therefore, the fairness of some countries' laws is often subjective
in nature. Some laws are general and open for judicial interpretation. Since ethics are the personal principles that govern
an individual's own behavior, it provides the individual with order and consistency rather than the entire society.

part of the response that the customer hears. Instead, a comment on the validity of the question and an offer to obtain the
answer are better responses. Asking the customer to hold while the employee tries to find the answer or to call later are
unsatisfactory ways of handling customer inquiries. Telling the customer there is no one on hand who can answer the
question is not a satisfactory way to handle a customer inquiry because it does not help the customer.

compromising and negotiating are part of normal procedure in serving customers. Explaining and demonstrating good
service as many times as you need to is the best way to deal with suspicious customers. Never pressing for sales or

Traditional. A traditional economy is a system in which people produce only what they must have in order to exist. As a
result, there is very little opportunity for businesses to develop and grow because the people do not have additional
income to spend on consumer goods. Many undeveloped countries have traditional economies. However, some
businesses are attempting to enter this market structure. For example, the tourism industry is expanding into undeveloped
countries which may lead to those countries having a different type of market structure in the future. It is not difficult for
businesses to develop and grow in capitalist, mixed, or socialist market structures.

slowdown is not corrected, the economy may go into a recession, which will continue to increase the unemployment rate.

Interest rates are low. Interest is the money payment for the use of borrowed money. Payment amounts vary when interest
rates change. The best time for a business's legal department to make an expensive purchase is when the interest rates
are low because the business will pay less money to finance the loan so it can obtain the equipment. Low interest rates
are common during an expansion of the business cycle. Declines in consumer demand, job growth, and the gross
domestic product are economic conditions that often occur when the business cycle experiences a contraction.

To improve performance. Team building involves developing cooperative efforts among employees and management to
accomplish company goals and objectives. One reason why many businesses encourage team building is that it tends to
improve the performance of the group so they are better able to achieve specific objectives. When team members work
together for a common purpose, they usually are more effective and perform better than when employees work
independently to achieve a common goal. Businesses do not encourage team building to obtain feedback, develop
training, or understand diversity.

To plan for the future. Everyone has plans for the future such as buying a home, starting a business, or retiring at a young

needed. For example, an individual might establish an investment goal of saving $10,000 in two years in order to make a
down payment on a house. To achieve a specific investment goal, an individual might buy stock in a company because
the stock is increasing in value. Reducing overall debt is one way to save money that can be invested. Individuals do not
establish investment goals to borrow capital.

Financial plan. The risk of financial loss is the basic risk in business. The key to reducing financial risk is the estimate of
financial needs, capital, to support alternative target returns for each aspect of the business. Therefore, the development
of a financial plan is a critical step in reducing business risk. The marketing plan is a set of procedures or strategies for
attracting the target customer to a business. The information system provides an organized way of gathering, sorting,
analyzing, evaluating, and distributing the data the business needs. Cash­flow analysis predicts whether the cash
generated by a business can cover the operating expenses and loan repayments. This analysis identifies the need for
capital but does not create it.

Yes, the business can forecast sales somewhere between its previous sales and the highest sales it would like to have.
Since sales forecasting is not a precise process, some businesses prefer to use a "probable outcome" method rather than
performing any calculations. This is not a sales forecasting method, but it does give businesses a figure with which to
work. The businesses look at their sales for previous years, set a sales goal they would like to reach, and forecast sales in
between these two figures. A competitor's forecast would not be available to another business. There is no law requiring
businesses to forecast their sales.

20%. One of the most important profitability ratios that businesses calculate is the percentage of gross profit on net sales.
In order to calculate the percentage of gross profit, subtract cost of goods sold from net sales and divide that amount by
net sales ($250,000 ­ $200,000 = $50,000 ÷ $250,000 = .20 or 20%). One reason why businesses track their gross profit
margin is to make sure that they are marking up the price of goods enough to earn the desired amount of profit.

Avoid increasing training costs. Effective selection procedures screen job applicants' background, experience, and training
in order to select the applicant who is best qualified for the available job. When new employees have the appropriate
training, the business saves training costs because it does not have to provide training for the new hire. The selection
process should focus on obtaining job­related information, as asking for personal information is often illegal. Effective
selection procedures cannot ensure that workers will be easy to manage or that they will like their jobs.

Real estate market is saturated or slow. When there is an abundance of properties for rent or sale, or fewer business
owners are looking for facilities to rent, there is more competition among property owners for buyers or leasers. The longer
a facility is unoccupied, the more money the facility owner loses. Therefore, facility owners are often more likely to agree
to potential leaser's requests (e.g., lower rent, interior painting) in order to obtain cash inflow from the rentals. Ownership
of multiple properties does not necessarily mean that the property owner is willing to provide concessions during lease
negotiations. Tax rates are established by governments and are not negotiable. A facility owner would probably have an
easier time finding tenants for a property that is located in a popular location. Therefore, the facility owner has more
influence in negotiating lease terms than the prospective tenant.
