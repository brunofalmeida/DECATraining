Appropriation. Torts are civil wrongdoings that cause harm or injury to another party. Appropriation,
wrongful interference, defamation, and conversion are four kinds of torts. Appropriation, which Brix
Beauty Salon committed, involves a business or person who useswithout permissionanother
person's name, likeness, and other unique characteristics for the benefit or gain of the user. Brix Beauty
Salon used the celebrity's name and picture to attract customers to the salon. Unfortunately, Brix had not
obtained permission to use the celebrity's name or likeness. As a result, the celebrity could sue Brix for
appropriation. Wrongful interference consists of predatory behavior undertaken by a business to draw
either customers or employees away from a competitor. Defamation involves making false, malicious
statements about a person or organization. Conversion occurs when personal property is taken from the
owner and given to someone else to use.

have purchased stock. A partnership is a form of business ownership in which the business is owned by

owned by one person. A cooperative is owned and operated by its user-owners to supply goods and
services to its members.

Channel management. Channel management involves understanding the concepts and processes
needed to identify, select, monitor, and evaluate sales channels. This example entails the transfer of
ownership of the computers from the manufacturer to the retailer. Promotion involves understanding the
concepts and strategies needed to communicate information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas
to achieve a desired outcome. Pricing is the marketing function that involves determining and adjusting
prices to maximize return and meet customers' perceptions of value. Product/service management is the
marketing function that involves obtaining, developing, maintaining, and improving a product or service
mix in response to market opportunities.

Intermediaries. Intermediaries are also called middlemen and include sales agents, wholesalers, and
retailers who perform specific functions in the movement of goods from producers to consumers. Direct

Green marketing. Green marketing refers to the practice of pricing, promoting, and distributing products
in such a way that they do not harm the natural environment. Most manufacturers choose to participate in
this practice because of their code of ethics. Consumer protection deals with safety features and product
labeling standards that protect the consumer. Social awareness is a term used to describe the practice of
enlightening the community of business actions to promote social welfare. International marketing refers

 6. B
Setting appropriate prices. Businesses not only need to make their products available, but they also must
sell them at a price that customers are willing to pay. If a product is not priced appropriately, customers
usually will not buy even if the product is widely distributed. Therefore, it is important for businesses to
coordinate the pricing activities with the appropriate channel members. Businesses must set appropriate
prices that customers are willing to pay and have the products in stock when customers want them in
order to successfully sell to customers. Coordinating the channel-management function with pricing does
not involve implementing accounting policies, earning high profits, or developing product standards.

To read useful information. Business employees often read written material to obtain useful information
that they can use to apply to a specific task or problem. For the information to be useful, the sources
must provide relevant, valid written material. For example, employees might read industry publications to
identify trends so the business can take steps to remain competitive. Industry information is relevant and
valid and useful to businesses. It is not important to identify sources that provide relevant, valid written
material to compile a database, understand business communication, or prepare a routine message.

Training materials. Employees are often expected to read a variety of company resources in order to
learn about and understand policies and procedures. Training materials are a type of resource that
companies often make available to employees. By analyzing the materials, employees learn about
company structure, business strategies, operating policies and procedures, etc. The more employees
know and understand about the company, the better able they are to perform effectively and advance in
the organization. Sales reports, promotional brochures, and research documents usually do not contain
information about company policies and procedures.

Encouraging the speaker. In many cultures, a standing ovation is the ultimate show of support for a
speaker. It indicates the audience's respect for the speaker, and its desire to hear what the speaker has
to say. Because cheering provides positive feedback, the audience was not mocking or insulting the
speaker. Some cultures might view the audience's behavior as unruly or disrespectful; however, this
situation involves a school event, rather than a business event, so the audience isn't exhibiting
unprofessional behavior. Because Jacob has not started speaking, the audience is not actively listening
to what he is saying.

Organize information. Organizing information helps you to communicate your message to your audience
in a meaningful way. One way to organize information is to write down key points on notecards (index
cards). Then, you can place the cards in their order of importance or categories. The advantage to using
notecards to organize information is that you can move them around and reorganize as needed. When
you have the information in the order that you want it in, you can efficiently write an outline, report,
manual, or article, or prepare a presentation. Placing key points on notecards and placing the cards in a
certain order will not help you access files, revise facts, or verify the information's accuracy.

Mtg. rescheduled for 3 p.m. An effective subject line for a professional email should summarize the body
of the message and make it easy for the recipient to understand the purpose of the email. "Mtg.
rescheduled for 3 p.m.", for example, clearly communicates the focus of the email (the meeting) and
provides enough information for the recipient to understand why the email was sent to him/her (to inform
him/her that the new time for the meeting is 3 p.m.). "New product information" is not specific enough for
the recipient to understand what product is the focus of the message. "One more thing . . ." and "Can we
talk for a minute?" are vague and provide little information to help the recipient understand the reason for
the email.

Make a decision. Informational messages are intended to inform and provide data to the recipients. In
many cases, the purpose of an informational message is to help the recipient make a decision. For this to
happen, the business employee should explain the situation and include sufficient data. If recipients
clearly understand the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the situation, they usually have
sufficient information to make a decision. Clear and concise writing enables a recipient to read the
message. The letterhead usually includes the business's name, address, and phone number so
recipients are able to contact the business. Explaining the situation and including sufficient data does not
guarantee that the recipient will agree with the content.

Minutes of a staff meeting. Simple written reports are often intended to provide information to the
business's employees. An example of a simple written report that a business might prepare on a regular
basis is the minutes of a staff meeting. Businesses often have routine staff meetings and prepare a brief
summary to distribute to all employees. This serves to remind employees of the topics discussed and
provide that information to employees who may have been unable to attend. Results of a research study,
findings of a major investigation, and analysis of a publicity campaign are examples of complex written
reports.

Body language. Body language is gestures, facial expression, tone of voice, or any other form of
communicating without words. An employee's body language conveys a message to customers. For
example, if an employee is talking to one customer and ignores a new customer, the employee's body
language is telling the new customer that s/he is not important. On the other hand, an employee who
smiles or motions that s/he will be with the customer shortly is communicating an interest in providing
good service. Employees usually do not communicate their social status to customers. The verbal and
nonverbal communications employees use during the closing statements indicate their interest in being of
service, not the closing statements themselves. Informal product demonstrations do not communicate
interest in providing good service to customers.

Delivering on the company's brand promise. A brand promise is a business's agreement (spoken or
unspoken) with customers that it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its brand
characteristics and values. By delivering on their company's brand promise, employees can reinforce the
company's positive image among customers. These employees become brand ambassadors,
communicating the company's vision, mission, and brand through their actions and words, both on the
job and off. Developing a broad product/service mix does not necessarily reinforce the company's
positive image. Betraying a company by sharing its intellectual property with competitors does nothing to
reinforce the company's positive image. Prestige pricing and price skimming do not reinforce a
company's positive image in every case.

Alertness and assertiveness. Alertness and assertiveness are two personal characteristics that are
interdependent with initiative. A sales representative can show initiative by being alert to information
about competitors and being assertive enough to express his/her views. Empathy is the ability to put
yourself in another person's place. Resourcefulness helps you to make the best of any situation.
Creativity is the ability to generate unique ideas, approaches, solutions, etc. Self-understanding is

Respecting the privacy. When employees respect the privacy of others in the workplace, they are more
likely to gain the trust and respect of their coworkers and managers. Respecting coworkers' privacy
means that an employee does not read correspondence that is not addressed to him/her. In addition, the
employee does not listen to others' private conversations or go through their personal belongings. In the
example, Amanda waited until her coworker Jeff returned from lunch to obtain a file that she needed.
Because she did not go through Jeff's workspace, she was respecting rather than violating his privacy.
The example does not indicate that Amanda's intention was to correct Jeff's work or to reinforce his
effortsshe simply needed to review information in the file.

use teams because workers who feel they are an important part of a team often work harder and produce
more. Other reasons that teams are important to businesses are that they reduce costs and workplace
conflicts. Teams do not increase procrastinationputting off until tomorrow what should have been done
today.

The agreed upon option is not always each person's first choice. Consensus is a decision-making
outcome that requires the substantial agreement of each group member. This means that for everyone to
agree, the option doesn't have to be each group member's first choice, but an option that has been
presented and agreed upon as acceptable by all members of the group. Minority rule means that a few
people in the group make the decision. Consensus is not minority rule, is not rule by a single leader, and
cannot be reached without each group member's input and agreement, which often requires

Being cooperative. Being a good listener is an example of being cooperative in the process of building

This includes listening attentively when your coworker is communicating with you. Being a good listener
is not an example of carrying your own weight. It may go along with getting to know others and having a
good attitude, but it is best as an example of being cooperative.

Store of value. Money functions as a store of value when it is saved rather than spent. The money can be
held over time, and it retains value for future purchasing power. In some situations, money is invested or
placed in an account that generates more value. Money also serves as a medium of exchange. This
occurs when money is used to obtain goods and services. Bartering involves trading one good or service
for another good or service. Money also functions as a measure of value. When money functions as a
measure of value, the individual holding the money assesses what s/he is willing to pay for a good or
service, thereby communicating the product's value or worth.

Transaction fees. Reconciling bank statements involves comparing the entries in a checkbook with the
entries listed on the bank statement. It is important to make these comparisons to determine
inconsistencies and mistakes. If a check is not recorded correctly, and if the mistake is not caught, the
individual runs the risk of having insufficient funds in his/her checking account, which results in bounced
checks. Some financial institutions charge transaction fees for checking accounts, so it is important to
make sure that those fees are subtracted from the checking account balance. Accumulated interest and
payroll deposits are added to the checking account balance rather than subtracted from it. Check
numbers are not subtracted from the checkbook when reconciling bank statements and checkbook
balances.

institution. The stock market itself does not provide financial services. A taxation department collects
various types of taxes. A retirement community provides housing rather than financial services.

Legal considerations. There are laws that regulate the reporting of financial information. Since accounting

considerations and understand what is legal and what is not. For example, there are laws regulating the
way that businesses report income and pay taxes. If businesses violate the law, they may be fined or
face other types of legal action. With regard to the accounting process, it is not necessary for all
businesses to be aware of management styles, system specifications, or research techniques.

subtract her total liabilities from her total assets. This gives her an accurate picture of her business's
health. A liquid asset is cash or any asset that can be quickly converted into cash. Accounts receivable
are money owed to the business for purchases made by customers. Dividends are sums of money paid

Has cash available to use. The cash conversion cycle is the ratio that reflects the number of days
between a company paying for raw materials and receiving cash from selling the products made from
those raw materials. The longer this period of time, the longer the company's money is tied up and
unavailable for other uses. Therefore, a financial manager strives to keep the cash conversion cycle as
short as possible, so that the business has more free cash to work with. A dividend is the amount of
money that a corporation pays to a stockholder as earnings on an investment. The profit margin is a
product pricing consideration. The profit margin is the amount of money that a business earns on sales
after expenses and is expressed as a ratio. Liquid assets are things of value that the business owns,
which can be quickly converted to cash.

Obscure relationships. Advances in technology have created software that allows for real-time analysis of

databases and identify obscure relationships. The software allows businesses to analyze the data as it is
collected and compare it with information stored in many other databases. For example, real-time
analysis might discover that a customer applying for store credit has the same telephone number as
another customer who recently declared bankruptcy. This information would be immediately made
available to the credit manager. Pricing strategies are plans for setting prices. A hidden objection is a real
objection the customer does not want brought out in the open. Distribution channels are paths, or routes,

Narrow the focus of the research if necessary. Many businesses allocate a specific amount in the budget
for marketing research. If the amount will not cover the expense of the entire research project, then the
business should stop at this point or narrow the focus of the project to the part that would be most useful
at that time. The steps in the marketing-research process must be taken in a specific order, and none of

Businesses segment markets in different ways. In the example, the athletic apparel store used
psychographics to divide the market, which means that the market is divided on the basis of a lifestyle
choicerunning. Geographic segmentation involves dividing a market on the basis of location (e.g., zip
code). Demographics are the physical and social characteristics of the population. A business that
segments the market on the basis of demographics considers factors such as the age, gender, and
ethnicity of the population. Rate of usage is a type of behavioral segmentation, which involves dividing
customers into groups according to their response to a product.

Presentation. Presentation is the way in which the information is communicated. It addresses such
factors as clarity of language used, sufficiency of font size, clarity of layout, effectiveness of colors,
usefulness of graphics or photos, clarity of audio or video (if included), and helpfulness of any animation
used. Presentation is particularly important on the Web since so much time is spent reading online.
Relevance deals with whether the information pertains to the topic being researched. Objectivity deals
with presenting unbiased information. Timeliness deals with how up to date the information is; however,
the importance of timeliness will vary from topic to topic.

Information systems. An information system is a method of gathering, storing, and analyzing data for the
purpose of making business decisions. Businesses acquire vast amounts of information that must be
stored and analyzed to make it useful. An effective information system enables a business to quickly and
accurately process information and use that information to make decisions. Businesses do not develop
operating procedures, survey methods, or management policies to be able to store and analyze data for
the purpose of making business decisions.

To handle returns. Businesses, such as retailers, keep a financial record of each sales transaction and
give a copy of the record, a receipt, to the customer. When a customer returns an item, a business uses
the information in the financial record to issue the customer a refund or a credit. The return transaction
also becomes a part of the business's financial records. Businesses do not keep records of sales
transactions in order to cancel orders. Rebates are a return of part of the price a customer pays for a
good or service. They are usually offered by the product's manufacturer rather than by retailers.
Expenses are monies the business spends, whereas sales transactions usually result in income.

Protecting consumer privacy. Businesses are becoming more concerned with ways of protecting
consumer privacy because of the new technology that makes it easy to gather and disseminate personal
information. The rapid growth of electronic commerce, which enables consumers to purchase products
online, also enables businesses to collect information about credit cards, personal preferences, and
buying habits that many consumers prefer to keep private. In response to a growing concern on the part
of consumers, businesses are trying to develop techniques that will protect consumer privacynot only
onlinebut also from other types of abuses. Economic expansion and marketing research are
fundamental business activities rather than current trends. Private enterprise is an economic system in
which individuals and groups, rather than government, own or control the means of production.

Consumer spending habits. An environmental scan is an analysis of external forces that influence a
business's success. By examining economic, political, socio-cultural, and technological factors that affect
the business, the business can take steps to ward off the threats and to take advantage of the
opportunities based on the information that the scan provides. Consumer spending habits are an
economic factor that might be a threat or an opportunity. If spending is increasing because the economy
is healthy, businesses will be able to increase production and sell more. Global trade regulations are a
political factor. Local demographics and restricted sales territories are not economic factors.

Below-cost pricing. When a company prices its products below cost, it makes it difficult for other
companies to compete with the low prices, which they cannot afford to charge, and might eventually force
them out of business. To prevent this situation from happening, many governments have laws that make
it illegal for businesses to use below-cost pricing. When a business charges one price for all items it sells,
it is using a one-price policy. Price skimming is a pricing strategy that involves setting prices higher than
those of the competition. Markup is the difference between the cost of a product and its selling price.

Improve existing products. As a result of advances in technology, new materials and operating
techniques have been developed. These materials and techniques have made it possible for businesses
to improve existing products. This impacts the product/service management function because it enables
businesses to extend the life of existing products and keep them on the market. Businesses have found
that it is usually less expensive to update existing products than to develop entirely new products.
Advances in technology are allowing businesses to do this. Advances in technology often help to reduce
human errors but cannot completely eliminate them. Advances in technology often make production
systems more complex because they rely on complicated computer systems. Businesses are not able to
control customer preferences.

Market opportunity. When a situation exists to fulfill a market's unmet needs, there is a market
opportunity. Entrepreneurs and businesses use creative-thinking techniques during the productdevelopment
process, which involves finding ways to take advantage of the market opportunity that
presents itself. Mind mapping is a creative-thinking technique that involves generating ideas by making
associations. To begin the mind-mapping process, you write the problem or market opportunity in the
center of a large sheet of paper. From that starting point, you draw lines to other words or phrases that
relate to the main idea (problem, or market opportunity), and continue the process by making
associations, which generates ideas and identifies possible solutions. The mind-mapping starting point
does not begin by writing down supporting facts or primary associations. A situational analysis is a
determination of a firm's current business situation and the direction in which the business is headed.

not call laws. These laws allow consumers to register their phone numbers with a do not call registry.

Newsletters, annual reports, and the company's website. Public relations involves establishing good
relationships between the business and the public. A business tries to maintain positive relationships with
different groups that make up the public, such as employees, local businesses, government officials, the

important to develop and maintain positive relationships with them. The public-relations department does
this by communicating with them through newsletters, annual reports, the company's website, and online
social networks. Print advertisements and commercials are forms of nonpersonal advertising. Businesses
use press releases and news conferences to convey information to the media. Policy manuals help guide
employees' actions on the job. Consumer blogs can be developed by anyone to communicate positive
