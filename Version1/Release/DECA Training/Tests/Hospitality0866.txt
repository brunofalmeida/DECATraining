Front desk supervisor, front desk clerks, auditors, reservationists, concierge staff, bell staff. These
positions are directly tied to the front office and the servicing of guests, and therefore, usually report to
the front office manager. Auditors and reservationists are essential to the front office operations. The gift
shop is often operated by a contractor rather than by the hotel. Housekeeping staff and maintenance staff
report to their specific departments, not the front office. The convention sales staff usually reports to the
sales and marketing department. The maintenance and golf course staffs are not responsible to the front
office manager.

Setting goals with marketing in mind. According to the marketing concept, setting goals with marketing in
mind evidences hotel commitmentthe theme of getting everyone in the hotel involved in marketing,
from the top down. Leaving marketing to marketers and assigning a small budget to marketing are two
ways to keep people from being involved or to limit marketing. In addition, teaching marketing to students
is honorable, but it does not demonstrate the marketing concept's theme of hotel commitment.

Balance sheet. A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial condition of the hotel
at that particular moment. A balance sheet lists a hotel's assets, liabilities, and net worth at a specific
point in time. Hotel accounting information often is summarized in a balance sheet in order to present the
data in a form that hotels can use to make decisions. Fiscal policy is the government policy that sets
levels of government spending and taxation. A sales forecast is a prediction of future sales over a
specific period of time. A trade report provides information about exports and imports.

Credits. Golf resorts maintain accounting records in which they list all transactions with guests. If a resort
receives payment for a vacation package in advance, the payment should be recorded as a credit in
order to indicate that the guest's account has a positive balance. The resort then is in debt to the guest to
provide service in the amount credited. A debit indicates that the guest owes the resort a payment.
Resorts that receive advance payments do not post those payments to guests' accounts as expenses or
liabilities.

To record unusual events, guest requests and complaints, and to update employees who are working
later shifts. Guests may have special requests and may not always speak to the same front desk
employee due to hotel shift changes. For this reason, a log book is kept to advise the new shift of guest
requests (e.g., delivery of a package) that have not been processed. It also records complaints (e.g.,
soiled bath towels). By monitoring the contents of the log, managers can often identify problems that
need to be addressed. Although front desk employees often have community information available for
reference, it is not usually recorded in the log book. In upscale hotels, this information is coordinated by
the concierge. Financial transactions as well as checking-in and checking-out activities are often
recorded by extensive computer systems and is not usually information that is recorded in front desk log
books.

Liability. Liability insurance protects the policyholder from claims of bodily injury or property damage
caused by the policyholder's vehicle. It also pays for repairs needed as a result of the accident. Health
insurance helps to pay medical bills. Whole-life insurance pays the insured's beneficiaries when the
insured dies. Property insurance covers losses to real and personal property.

Property. Hotels are responsible for the security of their guests, which also includes the safety of their

from theft. Hotels are not responsible for the guest's activity, entertainment, or transportation although
they may assist with those needs.

Verify the guest's identification and signature. Many hotels issue individual safe-deposit boxes for guests
to store their valuables (e.g., jewelry) while staying on the property. The safe-deposit boxes are kept in a
secure and locked location, usually in or near the hotel's front office. When guests retrieve their
valuables, hotel employees should verify the guest's identification by asking for photo identification such
as a driver's license or a passport. Generally, guests must sign a hotel form when getting items out of a
safe-deposit box. The employee should verify that the signature on the release form matches the
signature on the guest's identification. By taking these precautions, the hotel reduces the risk of theft and
provides the guests a sense of security. Not all boxes are secured by keys. Some properties keep the
boxes in a locked safe or use an electronic card to secure the box. Inventory storage report is a general
term and is not commonly used to describe release forms in the hospitality industry. Presentation of an
insurance card is dependent on the policies and procedures of individual lodging properties. In addition,
some items that are stored in a safe-deposit box are not necessarily insurable (e.g., documents).
Therefore, the guest would not have an insurance card.

Local regulations. Hospitality businesses often generate large amounts of trash and waste. There are
many ways that businesses dispose of waste products including incinerating, compacting, grinding, and
pulping waste products. For health and safety reasons, many local communities establish regulations
regarding waste disposal. For example, a large city might prohibit businesses from burning trash on the
property for safety reasons. Therefore, it is important for hospitality businesses to understand local
regulations when developing waste disposal plans. Pulping and grinding are methods of disposing of
certain types of waste and are not always used by hospitality establishments. Energy sources refer to
products that are used to power other products (e.g., electricity, gas).

Minors. Convention hotels usually are prevented from entering into legally binding contracts with certain
groups of people because these people are not considered to have the capacity to understand the
consequences of their actions. One of these groups includes minors, those people under the legal age.
In most cases, minors cannot enter into legally binding contracts because they are not old enough to be
responsible for the consequences. Convention hotels usually may enter into legally binding contracts with
people who are adults, older than the legal age, regardless of whether they are foreigners, senior
citizens, or tourists.

Intellectual. Many hotel chains own both tangible and intangible property. Intellectual is a type of
intangible property because it is not capable of being detected through the senses. Examples of
intellectual property include trademarks and trade names such as Hyatt and Marriott. Hotel chains usually
register their trademarks in order to legally protect them from being used or copied by other businesses.
Tangible property is capable of being touched, smelled, tasted, seen, or heard such as office equipment.
Statutory and administrative are not types of property.

E-mail. A confirmation is prepared by the hotel and provides the guest with verification that the room has
been booked for the requested time and place. It also verifies any specific needs that the guest might
have (e.g., computer access, balcony view). E-mail messages are sent by computer via Internet
connection. When a large lodging facility services high amounts of customers, e-mail can be sent quickly,
received quickly, and is usually less expensive than other means. The fax and telephone services are
utilities that are charged by usage. To send confirmation via the postal service, the business must pay for
stamps and stationery. The larger and busier the lodging facility, the more it pays for utilities, stamps, and
stationery.

The audience. The type of audience is an important factor that hotel managers should consider when
giving directions for completing job tasks. The audience's educational level and amount of professional
experience have an effect on how a manager will give directions. An experienced audience might need
very little instruction, while a group of new hotel employees might need very explicit directions on how to
complete a job. This is true no matter what organization, profession, or industry is involved.

True, when orders are filled quickly and accurately and items are seldom out of stock, sales generally
increase. An efficient distribution system has a major impact on sales volume. While efficient inventory
control can keep the hotel supply business from having too much of its capital tied up in stock, this has
nothing to do with increased sales volume. While personal selling impacts sales volume, it is not the
exclusive means of improving sales.

Promoting products. Channel intermediaries are persons or businesses that perform channel functions in
an indirect channel of distribution. They can be responsible for such marketing functions as buying,
selling, pricing, marking, storing, packaging, promoting, and financing. For example, channel
intermediaries might help hotel gift shops promote products. Recruiting workers for the business, training
employees, and monitoring union activities are human resource activities, not marketing functions.

On-time delivery. Competitive advantage is the edge achieved by businesses that offer something better
than their competitors. A hotel supply business that provides a service, or a better type of service, often
has an advantage over competitors that do not provide the same service. Providing on-time delivery often
improves customer service and also helps the business to have an advantage over competitors,
particularly if competitors do not offer delivery or delivery is slow and unreliable. Offering on-time delivery
may persuade customers to buy from one business rather than from its competitors. A business does not
have a competitive advantage if it offers standard products or routine credit terms that are provided by
other, similar businesses. Open-door policy is a business practice whereby management encourages
communication between employees and their superiors by stating that management's doors are always
open.

Move to marking area. Once shipments of goods have been received and checked, retailers usually
move them to the marking area in order to continue processing. Most retailers do not price mark goods in
the receiving area but move them to an adjacent area where there is sufficient space to attach price tags.
Retailers use a variety of stock-handling equipment in order to quickly move goods from the receiving
area to the marking area. Once goods have been marked, they may be sent to the selling floor, routed to
branch locations, or transferred to storage.

Allocate a small amount of space for storage. Some coffee shops prefer to have supplies and fresh food
items delivered daily. The advantage is that they need only a small amount of space for storage because
the items they use are replenished every day. Therefore, the frequency of delivery is often a factor when
considering the amount of space to allocate for storage. With daily deliveries, the coffee shop can
designate a small area for storage and use the majority of available space to prepare menu items and
serve customers. Having daily deliveries does not necessarily mean that the coffee shop can negotiate a
low price with many vendors or reduce the number of employees on staff. It will not be possible to
eliminate the need for refrigeration units because some food items must be refrigerated before use even
if they are delivered daily.

Monitoring stock on hand. One of the first steps in maintaining adequate inventory levels is keeping track
of the amount of stock on hand at all times. In order to know how much to order and when to order,
hotels first need to know what currently is available in inventory. Without this information, hotels might
order more housekeeping supplies than are needed or fail to order sufficient quantities to meet demand.
Ordering replacement goods, scheduling delivery dates, and negotiating purchase price are steps that
take place after a hotel determines the appropriate inventory level.

Type of product that is needed. Many factors are considered when developing food and beverage
requisition procedures: the size of the lodging's food and beverage facility, the menu, the type of service
provided (e.g., restaurant, banquet), and the type of product that is needed. Some items can be ordered
and stored for long periods of time (e.g., dry goods) while others are perishable (e.g., meat, dairy). For
example, if storage is available, sugar might be ordered in quantity to receive a quantity discount. On the
other hand, seafood items (e.g., lobster) often fluctuate in cost on a daily basis. When these types of
products are ordered, the food and beverage department might use a cost-plus method to ensure that the
department makes a profit at the time of sale. The manner in which a vendor manages its operations is
not generally a primary consideration when developing food and beverage ordering procedures. Menus
are created with guest appeal in mind. However, guests generally are not consulted when the facility
establishes procedures and makes purchasing decisions. Although it is possible for food and beverage
facilities to make purchases with cash, most larger facilities pay vendors upon receipt of an invoice.
Therefore, cash is not necessarily a primary consideration when establishing ordering guidelines.

Equilibrium. The point at which the quantity of a good that buyers want to buy and the quantity that
sellers are willing to sell at a certain price are exactly equal is the equilibrium price. In reality, the
equilibrium price is seldom, if ever, the price that actually exists in the marketplace because supply and
demand usually are not equal. Relative price is one price compared to another, that is, the ratio between
them. Market price is the actual price that prevails in a market at any particular moment. List price is the
manufacturer's suggested price for a product, and some businesses do offer goods at list price.

people. Every year, more and more businesses open and employ thousands of people. This leads to a
prosperous society in which people have jobs, earn an income, and spend money for more goods and
services. Because of competition, businesses offer more services and do research to develop products
that may eliminate diseases. These factors lead to a high standard of living which is not the same as a
prosperous society.

Data relevancy and application. Relevant information is data that has meaning and is useful to the
prosperity of the convention hotel. For example, keeping detailed customer records for defunct
businesses for several years does not help a convention hotel meet its current or projected sales
objectives. The data are not relevant and have no use or application to the current business situation.
Standards, mode, variables, range, sample size, and measurement are important considerations in the
marketing-information collection process. However, these factors or concepts are not necessarily
applicable to the overall, long-term marketing-information management process. These factors can
change or differ for individual research projects. For example, the sample size for one survey is not
necessarily the same for another project.

Because each group or organization has different needs and wants. By developing group profiles, the
hotel personnel have a detailed summary of what the group needs and desires to have a successful
event. For example, large groups may need more exhibit space and sleeping rooms than smaller groups.
Some groups require assistance with transportation if the attendees are flying into the area airport from
distant locations. Hotels often share information regarding associations or groups that hold meetings
annually and in different locations to other hotels (e.g., no-show rates) to aid in planning. Hotels do not
generally develop promotional materials for conventions, nor are the groups charged property tax for
hotel services. Profiles are not used to determine the level of service satisfaction; tools such as surveys

multiply current sales by the planned percent of increase ($675,450 x 6% or .06 = $40,527). Then, add

Ask guests if they need special accommodations and make a notation during the reservation process. By
asking about special needs during the reservation process, the hotel is better prepared to make and meet
the needed arrangements for guests. For example, a guest who is mobility impaired might need a room
with special bathroom accommodations and wide doors to accommodate a wheelchair. A guest with a
baby might need a crib in the sleeping room. Training or informing employees to be aware of special
needs of guests (e.g., those with hearing, visual, or mobility impairments) is a good idea. However, it is
not always necessary to have each employee learn sign language. Questionnaires are not usually
distributed at check-in. Front desk employees usually ask guests if they have special requests or needs.
Although it might be helpful to have wheelchairs or walkers at the hotel property for guests, most guests
with mobility impairments bring their own equipment with them to the property.

Put the notice in writing. Putting the notice in writing provides documentation that the hotel housekeeping
employee has been given notice if termination becomes necessary. The written notice serves as a
warning and gives employees an opportunity to improve. E-mail notification would not provide a
permanent written record and may violate confidentiality. Giving verbal notification only would not provide
a record in case of termination. Posting the notice on the bulletin board would violate employee

Expensive. Buying needed supplies on an emergency basis is usually more expensive because the
beach resort needs the supplies immediately and must pay the asking price. The resort that needs
replacement supplies in a hurry does not have the option of shopping around for the best price, which

efficient because it takes time that could be spent on more productive activities.

Keeping the exterior lights on a timing system. Unlike most other businesses, the hotel industry uses
electric, gas, and water 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Therefore, hotels have very high energy
usage and costs. Hotels try to conserve energy in many ways including light-timing systems. Timing
systems ensure that lights turn on and off at a given time and only when lighting is needed, as in the
evening or night. This practice conserves energy and cuts costs for the hotel. Asking customers to limit
bathing habits is not a customer-service oriented policy. This policy is usually implemented in case of an
emergency. Running the outdoor sprinkler system at all times increases energy use and costs and is not
necessary. Most hotel rooms have an individual heating and cooling system that is regulated by the
guest.

$3,982.50. Hotel supply businesses often analyze the accounts receivable component of cash flow in
order to find ways to speed up the flow of cash into the business. One way to encourage customers to
pay quickly is to offer discounts. The discounts reduce the amount of revenue the business receives, but
this disadvantage may be offset by the increase in cash flow. If a business with monthly sales of
$265,500 offers a 1.5% discount for payment within 15 days and all customers take advantage of the
discount, the business will lose $3,982.50 in revenue. To calculate this amount, multiply the amount of
sales by the discount ($265,500 x 1.5% or .015 = $3,982.50).

Connecting ideas to a particular color. Forcing associations means making a connection between two
things where an obvious connection doesn't already exist. For example, a forced association might

such as yellow taxi cabs or yellow school buses. Imagining a new shape for a traditional container is an

A hotel advertises a free breakfast buffet for guests on select mornings during slow seasons. Promotion
is defined as a marketing function that communicates information about goods, services, images, and/or
ideas to achieve a desired outcome. Advertising, coupons, frequent-buyer programs, and samples are a
few tools that marketers use to promote products. By advertising free goods and services (e.g., free
breakfast buffet), the hotel is implementing a promotional activity. A guest ordering room service or a
manager sending employees a memo regarding compensation information are not considered
promotional activities. A resort employee asking guests about room preferences is a selling activity.

A pharmaceutical company sells a common lifesaving drug at extremely high prices in specific
geographical regions. Social responsibility is defined as the duty of business to contribute to the wellbeing
of society. Because the drug is common and has the capacity to save lives, an unethical issue is
possible if the drug is sold at prices so high that some people can afford the drug while others cannot,
which might be considered price discrimination. An oil company that substantially increases its gasoline
prices when the workers at a large refinery go on strike does not necessarily present an unethical issue
since the refinery lacks human resources to supply enough of the product to meet demand. A
manufacturing company that increases prices on certain hotel supply items to cover expenses to add
new pollution control devices is acting in an ethical manner and employing social responsibility to the
natural environment. A hotel gift shop that deeply discounts goods in an effort to reduce excess inventory
from the previous selling season is not conducting socially irresponsible activities.

Make a profit. Each member of the channel of distribution, from producer to hotel gift shop, affects pricing
because all channel members try to make a profit on the products that they sell. The producer makes a
profit selling to middlemen. The middlemen increase the price when selling to hotel gift shops in order to
make a profit. Then, the gift shops add to that price to make a profit when selling to customers. Each
member in the channel adds a little to the price to make a profit. One of a business's main goals usually
is to make a profit. A business might set a price to create a certain image. A rebate is a return of part of
the price a customer pays for a good or service, usually offered by the product's manufacturer.

Child care. The hospitality industry offers many services to consumers, including dining, entertainment,
and lodging facilities. Within the lodging facility, the amount of services and the level of service vary.
Economy motels located near major highways offer traveling motorists simple, inexpensive sleeping
accommodations. Upscale conference centers might offer meeting and banquet rooms and audiovisual
equipment. Resorts might offer guests opportunities to enjoy on-site eating establishments, entertainment
and tours, horseback riding, and child-care services for parents. Lodging facilities might participate in
travel packages that include airline transportation. However, lodging facilities do not offer or provide the
transportation. The transportation company provides the service. Resorts generally provide a wide variety
of services. By offering a variety of options, guests spend more time and money on the property.
Although it is possible for a resort to cater outside events, the services are generally developed to serve
leisure or vacation guests.

Image in the eyes of consumers. A hospitality product's position is the way consumers view the product
as compared to their view of similar and/or competing products. Management's ability to position a
product helps determine the company's profit. Marketers can choose to position in relation to
competitors, target markets, product class, or price and quality. The physical characteristics of a product
are referred to as product features. However, many hospitality products do not have physical
characteristics. Product position does not mean the location in the property.

Product bundling. Product bundling involves combining several goods and services and offering them to
customers as one product. Usually, the bundled products are offered for one, all-inclusive price. Offering
a package that includes accommodations, meals, and a sightseeing trip is an example of product
bundling. In the hospitality industry, it is common for hotels to develop weekend packages to encourage
guests to stay at the properties during times when the hotels are not filled. Offering a weekend package
is not an example of price positioning, individual selling, or target advertising although hotels might target
the package to a specific audience.

Is a convenience to guests. Hotels with restaurants provide guests the opportunity to relax and dine
both of which are important to weary travelers. Hotel dining facilities are conveniences for guests
because they do not need to leave the premises to eat their meals. Guests who appreciate these types of
services are more likely to return to the hotel, which gives it a competitive edge over other nearby hotels.
In addition, groups that are planning meetings or conventions usually choose a facility that provides
complete service. This can increase a hotel's revenues substantially, thereby increasing its competitive
edge. Not all hotels offer room service, or the delivery of meals to the guests' rooms. Hotels with dining
facilities do not necessarily reduce the number of dissatisfied guests, if other services (e.g., clean rooms)
do not meet their expectations. Dining facilities do not necessarily increase the employees' productivity.

Positioning. Product positioning is the consumer's image or impression of a product as compared to that
of competitive products. One of the goals of product positioning is to make sure that consumers perceive
a product in the way that the hospitality business intended. This involves communicating information
about the product's attributes and characteristics so customers will have a clear perception of its image.
Product screening is the process of considering each idea for a new product and discarding those that
seem unworkable. Product development is the stage in the creation of a new product in which a working
model may be tested, modified, and retested, and production costs are estimated and final details of the
product are planned. Product management involves monitoring and developing one or more existing
products.

the guest has delivered to the room. Value refers to the amount of satisfaction a good or service will
provide a customer. Product is the good or service available for purchase (e.g., hotel room, delivered
food). Budgeting is an activity that organizations use to estimate income and expenses for the business
during a specific period of time.

involves contacting one person at a time. Personal selling usually occurs on a one-to-one or small-group

certain products will not be able to have pleasant lives. While socially responsible advertising may be
concerned with the environment, this is not a requirement. Slanting advertising to specific social groups is
target marketing and may or may not be socially responsible. Socially responsible advertising does not

comparison technique compares features or claims for one product with another.

There is an opportunity for the chain to build an ongoing relationship with customers. The use of
databases helps hotel marketers to direct their promotional efforts to specific target marketsmarkets
that hold the most promise for product purchases. Customizing and/or directing promotional efforts often
creates ongoing business relationships and customer loyalty. Although using databases for advertising
purposes can often increase brand loyalty, it does not necessarily enhance the hotel chain's image.
Follow-up procedures are actions a chain takes to determine the level of customer satisfaction with a
good or service after a sales presentation, regardless of whether or not a sale was made. Follow-up
procedures vary by business, and different methods of follow-up might cost more than others to execute.
Therefore, the use of database advertising strategies does not necessarily reduce follow-up expenses.
Some chains spend a lot of money to purchase data (e.g., mailing lists) for advertising purposes.
Depending on the method of message delivery (e.g., direct mail), it is possible that the cost per exposure
is more than other advertising media (e.g., television).

Look for new techniques that benefit customers. Building relationships through the use of effective
customer service involves helping customers in as many ways as possible. One way to help customers is
to always be on the lookout for new techniques that will benefit customers or information that might help
customers solve problems. When hotel supply salespeople are proactive and go out of their way to be of
service, they usually build long-term relationships with customers who appreciate the extra effort.
Salespeople should focus on relevant issues during sales calls rather than spend a lot of time visiting and
carrying on casual conversations. Salespeople who identify money-saving methods for their businesses
or help their businesses hire productive employees are assisting the business rather than building
relationships with customers.

An expense to the business. Hotel supply businesses often develop ways to attract more customers and
build a loyal clientele. One method is to offer several "free" services such as no-charge delivery and nointerest

that it gains more than it spends by increasing sales. Customers often do business with companies that
offer them useful free services and do not think of the services as more trouble than they are worth. The
salespeople do not pay for the services. The services usually are ongoing rather than tied to special

sell goods and services online to customers who also have access to the Internet. Selling online, or
e-commerce, is one of the newest and fastest growing marketing uses for computers. Chains do not
connect their computers to the Internet in order to make teleconferencing available or to keep track of
current inventory. Chains that have access to the Internet are able to view their competitors' sites, but
that is not the reason that they have their computers connected to the worldwide network.

Price discrimination. Price discrimination is an illegal activity in which a business charges different
customers different prices for similar amounts and types of products. If a picture frame manufacturer sells

manufacturer might be involved in price discrimination. Price discrimination is a violation of certain selling
regulations that are intended to protect customers. Geographic pricing involves charging different prices
based on location. Price competition is a type of rivalry between or among businesses that focuses on
the use of price to attract scarce customer dollars. Standard pricing implies that all customers pay the
same price.

Their products and competitors' products. By explaining product features in terms of benefits,
salespeople will be able to help customers understand the differences between their products and the
products of their competitors. In order to explain the differences, salespeople need to have product
knowledge and understand the specific features and benefits of their products. Effectively explaining the
differences will help salespeople to persuade customers to buy their products instead of the products of
their competitors. Salespeople explain hidden benefits and obvious benefits, but they do not explain the
differences between hidden and obvious benefits. Product features are physical characteristics.

customers the differences between using a credit card and paying cash.

Processing cash sales. Business employees should place a customer's money on the register's change
plate until they have given the change to the customer to eliminate disputes over the amount tendered. If
the money is in plain view, it is apparent how much was tendered. For example, if a customer pays with a
$20 bill, the customer cannot later claim that it was a $50 bill if the bill is still in plain view. This is an
important step in processing cash sales because it will prevent discrepancies that might be costly to the
business. The amount due is calculated before customers tender payment. If the bill tendered appears
questionable, employees should check to see if it is counterfeit before placing it on the change plate.
Money is not placed on the change plate in order to record sales transactions.

Listing number and value of each denomination. When employees open the cash register each day, they
place the beginning change fund in the cash drawer. Part of this process involves listing the number and
value of each denomination of coin and currency. For example, an employee would count the number of
coins and then list the number and value such as dimes, 30, $3. The list indicates if the employee
received the correct amount of change. Also, this list is used to prove cash when the employee closes
the register for the day. Employees cannot verify credit and debit transactions when opening the cash
register because those transactions occur later. Employees often obtain information about daily
promotions and review prices and discounts on merchandise. However, these activities are not part of
opening the cash register.
