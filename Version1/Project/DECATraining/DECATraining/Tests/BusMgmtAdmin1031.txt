Agreement. In order for a contract to be legally binding, an offer must be made by one party and
accepted by the other party. In effect, the two parties are agreeing. The competent parties provision
requires those entering a contract to be of legal age and meet other criteria. Legality refers to the terms
of the offer being within the law, and consideration requires something of value be exchanged.

Fiduciary. An agent is someone who acts on the behalf of another party. The agent often negotiates
contracts and handles legal issues for another person with that person's consent. The agent who shows
that s/he is loyal, trustworthy, and acting in the best interest of his/her client (principal) is fostering a
fiduciary relationship. Authoritative relationships are based on a particular level of control. Principal is a
legal term that describes the client. Legislative processes involve the procedures in which people or
governments establish laws.

3. C
Respect of coworkers. Being able to listen effectively is an important skill in the world of work. Employees
who listen to others and try to understand what they are saying usually are able to respond appropriately.
The benefit is that they earn the respect of coworkers because they take the time to try to truly
understand what others are saying. As a result, they are able to answer questions, complete job
assignments correctly, and assist coworkers when necessary. Being able to listen effectively might lead
to a promotion but does not guarantee it. Being able to listen effectively does not necessarily mean that
employees will have access to management. Employees who listen effectively often have more
responsibility rather than fewer assignments.

Greet the customer by name. If a salesperson is making calls from a prospect list, use of the customer's
name will be easy and adds a personal touch to the telephone call. It may not be appropriate to call a
potential client at home. Asking questions will reveal information about the client's needs and wants but
does nothing to personalize the conversation. The use of a merchandise approach means to make
reference to a particular good/service in initiating a conversation with the customer.

Time the presentation. Rehearsing the presentation provides the businessperson with an opportunity to
time the presentation and decide what revisions are needed before the actual presentation. In many
situations, businesspeople are allowed only a certain amount of time to make presentations. Therefore, it
is necessary to include all the important information within that time frame. Timing the presentation in
advance will allow the businessperson to be sure that the complete message is being presented. Visuals
should be prepared in advance in order to use them during the rehearsal. All information should be
included in the presentation before it is rehearsed. Businesspeople do not rehearse presentations to
anticipate questions.

Benefits of taking action. The purpose of writing persuasive messages is to convince customers to do
something such as buy a product or pay an overdue bill. To encourage them to take the correct action, it
is important to appeal to their needs and show them why it is a benefit to do what you want them to do.
For example, if you want customers to buy a new product, explain how that product will benefit them,
such as by saving money or speeding up production. Customers are more likely to respond favorably
when they understand how their needs will be satisfied, and they will benefit from taking action.
Customers usually are not interested in the business's point of view or predictions for the future unless
those predictions will benefit them. Persuasive messages are more effective if they explain how
customers will benefit rather than explaining the technical aspects in detail.

Attachments. Writers of simple reports may want to include additional information that further explains the
report but is not necessary for its understanding. This type of information, such as graphs, charts, and
statistics, may be included as attachments. Receivers of the report can decide whether or not they want
to take the time to read the attachments. References, bibliographies, and resources are types of
attachments that refer readers to other sources of information. They are most often associated with long,
complex reports.

Logical arguments. An analytical report is a document that explains and evaluates an issue, opportunity,
or problem. When developing an analytical report that addresses a controversial issue or contains
information that readers might disagree with, the writer should provide logical arguments that explain and
support their conclusions. By providing logical arguments, the writer is more likely to persuade readers to
accept the conclusions. Technical statistics may distract the reader. Personal opinions should not be
expressed during an analytical report. Enthusiastic statements that do not provide logical arguments or
supporting evidence are less likely to convince readers that the conclusions are reasonable.

The purpose of this study is to determine why sales have been decreasing for three consecutive
quarters. A research report is a written document that summarizes an investigation related to a particular
issue or problem. A comprehensive research report contains several sections. In the introductory section
of the research report, the writer identifies the problem and the purpose of the report, such as declining
sales. Recommendations are detailed at the end of the report. Details about the research process, such
as survey data, are addressed in the methodology section of the research report. Statistics are included
in the results section of the research report.

Grapevine. The grapevine is an oral communication method in which information is passed around the
company, but it is not formally announced or verified. Managers usually are unable to control the
grapevine because employees tend to talk to each other and share whatever information they have—
even if it is not accurate. Managers can sometimes use the grapevine by providing correct information to
employees they know are involved in the grapevine. Downward communication moves from management
to the lower-level employees. Formal communication is the official information provided by the business.
An objective is a desired outcome rather than a channel of staff communication.

Needs. Needs are requirements of some sort—the things that people must have in order to lead full and
happy lives. Employees should provide service based on the customers' needs, not on what they think
the customers need. Considering what customers need will help employees to provide good service and
satisfy those needs. Good service should be provided regardless of customers' wages, habits, or
appearance.

Hidden complaint. The customer has concealed the true complaint with a believable but secondary
reason for the dissatisfaction. Objections are customers' reasons for not buying. A false accusation is an

Prices go down. The law of supply and demand states that the supply of a good or service will increase
when the demand is great (prices increase) and will fall when demand is low (prices decrease). By

Value. Value is the amount of satisfaction a good or service will provide a customer. Price often indicates
value because customers usually are willing to pay more for items they value highly. Price is the amount
of money paid for a good, service, or resource. Incentive is the motivator for change or action. Any
circumstances under which buyers and sellers exchange products for a price is considered a market.

It is inappropriate to use humor with Germans in business situations. Germans tend to be very formal and

Social interaction and getting to know a business associate on a personal level is not a priority because
Germans tend to be private about their personal lives. German businesspeople generally prefer structure

Blaming another person for his mistake. Taking responsibility for your actions involves accepting the
consequences (good or bad) of your behavior, admitting and learning from your mistakes, and trying to
do better in the future. In the example, Jason blamed the office assistant for the mistake, but he is the
employee who is responsible for ordering the washers. By blaming another employee, Jason is failing to
accept responsibility for his actions. Jason was not helping Susan to resolve the problem, providing a
valid reason for the stock-out, or denying that a problem exists.

Determine the time it takes to complete various tasks. Before tackling your work, you need to determine
all the tasks that you need to do in relation to the time it takes to complete each task. You must also
consider the importance of each task, which may be determined by their due dates. By analyzing the time
it takes to complete your tasks in relation to their importance, you can schedule your workload and allow
enough time to complete them, which is an important consideration, if unexpected situations occur that
require immediate attention. Tasks should not always be completed in the order of their difficulty. Least
important tasks should be completed after the most important tasks.

Accurate and up-to-date. Accounting records show the financial health of a business. If its accounting
records are inaccurate or out of date, a business cannot be sure what its financial situation is. Posting is
transferring accounting information from a daily journal to the appropriate ledger, and it can be done by
bookkeepers or clerical staff. The chief executive officer of a business would not have time to approve all
the accounting information the system contains. A business may use either the cash accounting method
or the accrual method. In the cash accounting method, income and expenditures are recorded at the time
the money changes hands. In the accrual method, transactions are recorded at the time they occur even
if no money changes hands.

Make adjustments. A budget is only as successful as the business that evaluates it on a regular basis.
When business owners want to know if they are accomplishing their goals, budgets show where they are
on target and where they are not. By comparing original budget figures to actual figures, managers can
find out if they are spending more than allocated on certain activities and then make adjustments. For
example, if a business spends most of its advertising budget during the first six months, it knows that it
will need to cut back in that area or take money from other activities. Businesses do not evaluate their
original budgets in order to change investments, establish quotas, or follow procedures.

Human resources. Human resources management is the process of planning, staffing, leading, and
organizing the employees of the business. The human resources function is responsible for developing
and implementing employee orientation programs. Orientation involves helping new employees get
acquainted with their surroundings, providing them with general company information (e.g., policies), and
preparing them to do their jobs (e.g., training). Funding acquisition is a financial function. Information
management is the function that maintains and disseminates the business's data for decision-making
purposes. The security function protects the business's resources from harm or unauthorized access.

personal "know-how" that affects the ways in which s/he does his/her job. An employee who develops
and executes a process that helps her/him work more efficiently has tacit knowledge. Raw data are data
that have not been transformed into meaningful information. Statistics are information presented in

Transparent. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight, and information of
internal and external resources to help an organization achieve its goals. Transparency is the quality of
being just as one's seems—trustworthy. When employees have expertise or personal insight that can
help the business achieve its goals, they should share their knowledge with their employers. Sharing
knowledge means that the employees have a transparent attitude; they are willing to share their knowhow,
and they are not deliberately concealing knowledge that will help the business achieve its goals.
Although curiosity and ethical behavior are desirable traits, they are not needed for effective knowledge
management processes. Businesses do not, as a general rule, want employees to be argumentative.

Accountability matrix. An accountability matrix is a table that assigns tasks to workers and tracks the
workers' progress in relation to various business or project activities. Accountability matrices are
components of project-management software. Businesses may design their own accountability matrices

the business records and maintains information about its customers. A surveillance system consists of
audio/visual equipment that is used to monitor various activities. Magnetic cards (e.g., debit cards, credit

surveillance systems, and magnetic cards to assign and track various business tasks.

An organic farm obtains a patent for a new hybrid tomato plant. Intellectual property is intangible
business assets resulting from thinking processes. Businesses can obtain legal protection of their
intellectual property from the government. When a business invents a new product (e.g., tomato plant),
the business would apply for a patent. The patent is granted to the inventor or owner for a specific
number of years. The patent is a legal means of preventing the product from being recreated and
distributed by unauthorized entities. Copyrights legally protect musical compositions. Trademarks can be
obtained to protect trade characters. Copyrights or trademarks can legally protect logos. A business that
uses a similar logo as another company, and an online business that illegally distributes music are
examples of ways that intellectual property is not being protected. A manufacturer that hires a graphic
artist to design a trade character will need to legally protect the trade character after it is developed.

Comparing and ordering concepts. Knowledge management involves leveraging the expertise, insight,
and information of internal and external resources to help an organization achieve its goals. An important
aspect of knowledge management involves capturing the expertise, insight and information, so the
business can use it in meaningful ways. A business can use many different tools to capture knowledge in
an organization. Sorting techniques allow the business to compare all of the data and information that it
has collected, categorize it, and place it in a meaningful order or sequence. This process allows the
business to look at all of the knowledge that it has gathered in different ways. This often helps the
business determine efficiencies and inefficiencies within the business. Sorting techniques often help a
business determine if any of the information that it has collected is confidential or relevant. After sorting
and analyzing the information, the business may decide to take corrective action by changing some of its
objectives.

Safety inspections. Governments develop regulations to ensure the safety of workers. Some government
regulations require that businesses have their machinery inspected on a regular basis by a government
agent or independent entity to ensure that the business is complying with safety regulations. During the
inspection, the inspector might identify problems or hazards that compromise worker safety. By
identifying the problems, the business can take corrective action to ensure worker safety and to be in
compliance. Undergoing accounting audits, tax assessments, and ethics training programs are not
actions that will identify workplace hazards.

compares the business's existing processes with the CMMI model to evaluate efficiency levels. The audit
results guide the business's decision making by examining both the efficient processes and inefficient
processes. By using the CMMI model, the business can integrate its successful processes with those
suggested by the CMMI model, which can help the business's quality improve. The purpose of the CMMI
quality management framework is to facilitate quality improvement rather than develop long-term financial
