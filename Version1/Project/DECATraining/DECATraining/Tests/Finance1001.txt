To avoid paying penalties. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a federal governmental agency that writes and enforces safety and health standards for businesses. OSHA has the authority to impose financial penalties on financial-services firms that are in violation of OSHA regulations. These penalties may be significant depending on the type of violation. Also, OSHA may give a financial-services firm a certain amount of time to correct the violation and impose additional penalties if the problem is not corrected by then. OSHA has the authority to make on-site inspections at any time. Financial-services businesses comply with OSHA regulations to prevent work-related accidents rather than to monitor the number of accidents. Complying with OSHA will not eliminate all complaints but will make the workplace safer for employees.

Pyramid schemes. Pyramid schemes are recognized as illegally run businesses that operate by using multi-level marketing strategies. Typically, pyramid clubs require potential members to pay an investment fee up front. Sometimes this amount can be thousands of dollars. Most of the emphasis is on recruiting new members, so that more investment fees can be collected. Very little emphasis is placed on product attributes or quality. Deceptive advertising refers to the use of nonpersonal, paid promotional venues to mislead the audience about the attributes of a product. Marketing rackets and pressure-cooker tactics are not recognized terms in regard to multi-level marketing concepts.

Leave a good last impression with callers. Leaving a good last impression is just as important as creating a positive first impression. An investment firm's employees do not want the professional image they have created to be ruined in the last seconds of the call. Concluding calls pleasantly may help you to get a good performance review, but that is not the purpose of it. Providing callers with accurate information and making good use of your time are not part of ending calls pleasantly.

Features and benefits. When they are planning on making large or expensive purchases, some business customers ask the business to submit written sales proposals. Because the goal of the proposal is to make a sale, a well-written proposal will tell the customer the benefits of purchasing the business's products. The sales proposal should also point out the specific features of the products which may be different from the features of a competitor's product. The proposal might include shipping information, but receiving is controlled by the customer. The proposal usually includes pricing information but not accounting information. Laws and regulations usually are not part of a sales proposal unless the product is one that is regulated by the government.

Decrease in sales. Maintaining good client relations is important to a financial-services firm because clients who receive poor treatment may move their accounts to competitors and never return to the firm, resulting in decreased business for the firm. Also, clients who are poorly treated may tell their friends and others about the treatment, and these people may decide not to use the firm's services, thereby adding to the firm's losses. Failing to maintain positive client relations probably would not result in a loss of advertisers, a reduction in assets, or a lowering of goals.

By requesting input through employee and customer surveys. Service-oriented companies are generally committed to providing exceptional service levels. Service-oriented companies are always looking for ways to improve their service levels. Requesting feedback from employees and customers regarding service levels is one way businesses can evaluate and improve service. Testimonials are statements by identified users of a product proclaiming the benefits received from the use of a product. Distributing testimonials, evaluating product development procedures, and conducting a feasibility analysis are not methods that businesses generally use to improve their service levels.

Let them have their say. The best way to deal with domineering/superior customers is to let them have their say. But in the end, make sure that the right thing is done. Never pressing for sales or decisions is the best way to deal with leave-me-alone customers. Avoiding jumping to quick conclusions is the best way to deal with dishonest customers. Explaining and demonstrating good service as many times as you need to is the best way to deal with suspicious customers.

Buying power. Buying power is the customer's ability to purchase based on the amount of his/her disposable income. Other factors that affect the price decision are satisfaction (value) and relative prices. Incentive is a function of relative price that encourages producers to change and reallocate their resources. Rationing is a function of relative price that affects who gets the goods or services that are produced. Production costs affect how much a customer has to pay for a product versus willingness to purchase.

A lower rate of inflation. When a lot of people are out of work, they lose their buying power, which means less money is in circulation. Because unemployed people have less disposable income, the demand for goods and services is low, which tends to slow or lower the rate of inflation (rise in prices). The amount of monetary policies that the Fed establishes does not affect unemployment rates. When the GDP grows, an economic expansion is occurring, which indicates that people and businesses are spending money, and the unemployment levels are low.

To make plans that will level out cycles. By understanding whether business activities will be expanding or contracting, businesspeople can take steps to avoid the extreme ups and downs of business cycles. They can anticipate changes that will be needed in employment, production, pricing, and purchasing. These plans, however, will not prevent cycles from happening. Unfortunately, businesspeople cannot predict precisely when business cycles will begin or end, how long they will last, or how severe they will be. There is no single cause of business cycles.

Financial condition. The rate of unemployment indicates the number of individuals who are out of work but who want a job. This is an economic factor that may have an impact on a business's financial condition because if people are unemployed, they do not have extra money to spend on products. As a result, a business's sales and income might decrease. This usually has a negative effect on a business's financial condition. The rate of unemployment does not impact a business's tax structure or depreciation level. Governments develop monetary systems.

Aptitudes are natural talents for learning specific skills. Creativity is the ability to generate unique ideas, approaches, or solutions. Patience is the ability to endure life's aggravations and difficulties calmly.

Culture. The culture of an organization involves the way the organization operates in regard to its treatment of employees and customers. The way businesses (e.g., financial-services companies) behave indicate the type of culture that exists in the businesses. For example, some businesses encourage employees to participate and share ideas, and work hard to develop strong relationships with both employees and customers. Other businesses have a culture that makes employees feel unimportant and does not acknowledge their effort. The way a business behaves and treats both its employees and its customers is not the organization's mission or goal. However, the way a business behaves might be a strength if it treats employees and customers in a positive way. On the other hand, the behavior might be a weakness if it reduces morale and has a negative effect on employees.

Higher prices. Businesses that offer credit to their customers usually charge higher prices for their goods and services than those that do not. This change in the pricing element of the marketing mix helps businesses recover the costs of extending credit. Interest rates are fees the lender charges the borrower for the use of the money. Annual fees are yearly fees charged for the privilege of using a bank credit card. Finance charges are interest charges on credit accounts that are not paid in full at the end of each payment period. They are usually a percentage of the total amount due.

$924.28. The total value of a bond is the sum of the present value of the bond at maturity and the present value of each of the payments (an annuity). The present value of the bond at maturity is given at $621. To find the present value of the payments, the payment amount is multiplied by the value that corresponds to the required rate of return and the number of periods on a present value of an annuity table. As noted above, the value at 10% for 5 years is 3.791. Therefore, the present value of the payments is $303.28. To calculate this amount, first determine the annual payments by multiplying the bond amount by the coupon rate ($1,000 x 8% or .08 = $80). Then, multiply that figure by the table value ($80 x 3.791 = $303.28). The total value of the bond is $924.28; $621 (from the bond at maturity) plus $303.28 (from the payments).

$266,140. A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial condition of the business at a particular moment. One of the three main components of a balance sheet is the business's assets, which include anything of value that the business owns. Assets include items such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, buildings, land, and investments. To determine the business's assets, add the accounts receivable, the value of the inventory, and the value of the building and equipment ($6,800 + $13,590 + $245,750 = $266,140). A mortgage is a debt rather than an asset.

Changes in the number of competitors in the market, the length of a national recession, and the levels of consumer spending are external changes.

$36,000. Calculating depreciation using the straight-line depreciation method is done by subtracting salvage value (in this case, $8,000) from cost ($80,000). The remainder is then spread evenly over the expected useful life of the machine (6 years). Thus, ABC's new canning machine is depreciated $12,000 each year; at the end of year 3, total accumulated depreciation is $36,000. Total accumulated depreciation is $12,000 at the end of year 1, $24,000 at the end of year 2, and never $44,000.

7%. The rate of return on a corporate bond is the yield, which is stated as a percentage. Investors want to know the yield in order to decide if the return on investment is comparable to other investments. To calculate the rate of return, or yield, first calculate the annual interest by multiplying the original price of the bond by the interest rate ($2,000 x 6.5% or .065 = $130). Then, divide the annual interest payment by the current market value of the bond to determine yield ($130 ÷ $1,850 = .0702 or 7%).

Improve profit margins. Profit margin is a ratio of net profit (after taxes) divided by net sales that reflects the profit per dollar of sales. One way to improve profit margins is to keep costs low while increasing sales. If there are fewer expenses, then the cost of doing business decreases, and there is more money remaining. This results in a higher profit margin. Keeping costs low while working to increase sales is not a way for businesses to eliminate product shortages, monitor liquid assets, or develop budget goals. However, controlling costs and increasing sales might be budget goals.

Deferred annuities. An annuity is a type of investment that earns interest. There are different types of annuities such as fixed, variable, and deferred.

$1,710. Individuals often evaluate mutual funds on the basis of average return to decide if the funds are a good investment. In some situations, 12% might be an acceptable return. In this case, the return is expected to increase by 2% this year and become a 14% return (12% + 2% = 14%). To calculate the worth of the investment based on the increased return, multiply the amount invested by the new return ($1,500 x 14% or .14 = $210). Then, add the cost of the investment and the return ($1,500 + $210 = $1,710).

Time charges. Businesses that bill clients for time or labor charges usually develop an hourly billing rate that covers all the costs associated with providing the service. These costs usually include wages and salaries, benefits, operating expense, and desired profit.

If the business spends 5 hours preparing tax statements and the hourly billing rate is $75, the client's statement will indicate a charge of $375. Businesses do not use an hourly billing rate to bill clients for interest fees, bond payments, or cash advances.

Without an effective system in place, financial institutions may not be able to adhere to a compliance plan. Adhering to a compliance plan does not involve following various industry policies and procedures, security methods and techniques, or privacy requirements and laws.

10%. Return on investment is the product of profit margin and total asset turnover. With an ROI of 18% and total asset turnover of 2 times, profit margin is 9%. To determine profit margin, divide ROI by asset turnover (18% or .18 ÷ 2 = .09). In order to increase ROI to 20% while total asset turnover remains constant, profit margin must increase to 10%. To determine this, divide the new ROI by asset turnover (20% or .20 ÷ 2 = .10 or 10%).

Risk-return tradeoffs. When businesses evaluate the cost of purchasing certain assets in the hope that these assets will have significantly more value in the future, they are assessing whether the risk of investing is worth the expected return. Businesses often take the risk of investing in certain assets because they believe the assets will increase in value. The tradeoff is spending money now in order to have more valuable assets in the future. However, the risk is that the assets will decrease in value and the business will lose money. Cash-flow projections are predictions of whether the cash generated by a business can cover the operating expenses and loan repayments. Profit-margin requirements are the percentage of profit the business wants to make based on income from sales. Short-term objectives are goals that can be achieved in less that a year.

Emergency situations. Businesses develop budgets to plan for future income and expenses. Before finalizing a budget, businesses usually review it to make sure they have included all the important components. One of these components is allocating funds for emergency situations. Businesses know that unexpected situations may arise which require the expenditure of cash. If businesses have budgeted for an emergency fund, they are prepared to cover these costs. When troubleshooting a proposed budget, businesses do not consider if funds have been allocated for depreciation activities, appraising acquisitions, or identifying investments. However, they may allocate funds to make acquisitions that might include investments.

$96,750. Businesses often forecast future financing needs to make arrangements to borrow the funds needed for certain activities, such as purchasing equipment. In this situation, the business has more income than expenses but not enough to cover the cost of purchasing the equipment. To calculate financing needs, subtract expenses from income ($375,000 - $296,750 = $78,250). Also, subtract from that figure the amount the business wants to maintain in a cash reserve ($78,250 - $50,000 = $28,250). The business will have $28,250 available to put towards the purchase of the equipment. Subtract that amount from the price to determine financing needs ($125,000 - $28,250 = $96,750).

Industry averages. Businesses often analyze a variety of financial information to determine net profit, return on investment, inventory turnover, etc. These figures indicate trends that are important to the business. For example, a business might find that it is not selling inventory as quickly as it should and has too much money tied up in inventory. By comparing this with industry averages, a business can determine inventory turnover in similar businesses. If its turnover is very low compared to the industry average, the business knows it must take steps to correct the problem. Businesses do not conduct a trend analysis to compare their financial ratios with current liabilities, operating standards, or variable expenses.

Long-term financial needs. Businesses acquire a variety of assets over a period of time. These assets include equipment, property, investments in other companies, and cash.

For example, a business might invest in high-yield bonds to generate a lot of cash in ten years. Businesses do not consider basic accounting methods or fee-only brokerage firms when determining the optimal mix and type of assets. Individuals rather than businesses usually are concerned with estate planning services.

Tax exempt. Individuals often consider the impact of taxes on investments because most investment income is taxable. Depending on the type of investment, the tax may be very high, which might discourage potential investors. However, the interest on certain types of municipal bonds is tax exempt, so investors earn income on which they do not pay taxes. This is an attractive feature of municipal bonds. However, the interest on those bonds usually is low rather than extremely high. Interest is paid when the bonds mature. The interest on bonds is income rather than a deduction.

Businesses often accelerate cash receipts by offering discounts, which encourage customers to pay quickly in order to take advantage of the discounts. Although the business reduces the amount it receives, it obtains the funds in a short amount of time and has more cash on hand. Businesses routinely send payment notices, make deposits, and approve purchases. However, these activities do not accelerate cash receipts.

Delaying cash outlays. Effective cash management involves delaying cash outlays so that the company profits as long as possible from having cash. At the same time, cash inflows should be accelerated as much as possible. Keeping a high minimum cash balance is not effective cash management if the cash could be used more profitably on projects or through investment.

Invoice the correct individual. Receivables are monies owed the business. To collect, businesses must invoice the correct person. If the correct person does not receive the invoice, it may delay the payment process. They do not need to call human resources or issue a press release when things go wrong. Conducting professional development seminars may or may not directly influence the effective managing of receivables.

Accounts payable. For non-financial corporations, accounts payable (or trade credit) is the largest category of short-term financing. Accounts payable are all monies owed by the business to others. If a company delays paying its bills, it will have more funds available. Accruals are continual short-term debts over which a company may have little realistic control. A commercial paper is an unsecured loan issued by a corporation. A promissory note is the document signed when a bank loan is approved.

Control the investment. Businesses often have a significant investment in inventory. However, businesses do not want to have any higher investment in inventory than is necessary to satisfy customers. Managing inventory is one way to control the investment. Therefore, businesses monitor inventory levels to keep the right amount in stock without spending more than is necessary. Managing inventory does not involve arranging for delivery, monitoring the workforce, or estimating the revenue.

Break up value. When a firm is to be acquired, the valuation can be performed according to break up value—as if the individual parts were sold separately.

The smaller the deviation, the riskier the investment. When analyzing the variance of securities, the smaller the deviation, the lower the risk of the investment. The first step in variance analysis is determining expected return, which is the sum of the possible returns and their respective probabilities. Each return is then subtracted from its expected return in order to come up with a deviation. One of the steps in conducting a variance analysis is squaring the deviations; this is done to eliminate any negative values.

Inform stockholders of the condition of their investment. An annual report is a document outlining the financial status of a business. Most annual reports also include a summary of the business's activities throughout the year. Businesses that have stockholders usually prepare annual reports to inform stockholders about the condition of their investment. The report also might contain an analysis of the dividends that were paid to stockholders during the year. This information indicates if stockholders are earning an acceptable return on their investment. The report might summarize the business's activities, but it would not analyze the operating procedures. Annual reports are not intended to encourage stockholders to provide useful feedback or to generate worldwide publicity.

Accounts receivable. These are all monies owed to a business by its customers. Businesses evaluate accounts receivable because they often generate future income. In many cases, businesses sell products and send invoices to customers who may pay the invoice when received or pay the invoice in 30 to 90 days. If customers are slow paying, the business may not receive the income it needs to operate. Therefore, evaluating accounts receivable will help a business decide if it needs to make changes to obtain revenue on a timely basis. Cash payments are the money that a business spends. Money supply is the total quantity of money that exists at one time in the nation. Profit margin is a ratio of net profit divided by net sales.

Vertical. There are several types of financial analyses that businesses use to evaluate the performance of the business. One of these is vertical analysis which involves listing each item on the income statement as a dollar amount and also as a percentage of another item on the income statement. For example, a business might state each item as a percentage of sales because it is important to know the relationship between expenses and the sales revenue. Stating each item on an income statement as a dollar amount as well as a percentage of sales is not an example of horizontal, ratio, or operating analyses.

Amount of interest that accumulates. Deferred annuities are investments that pay income in the future. Therefore, the future value of the annuity is determined by the amount of interest that accumulates from the date of purchase until the investor begins to take out income. For example, a $10,000 annuity that earns approximately 7% interest a year has considerable more value in 10 years than it does in five years. The investor does not manage an annuity. Annuities do not pay dividends. The future value of deferred annuities is not determined by the ongoing level of financial risk.

Total finance charges. The annual percentage rate (APR) is the cost of credit on a yearly basis, stated as a percentage per $100 borrowed.

The annual percentage rate is not used to calculate stock values, future cash needs, or liquidity costs.

Inflation. When measuring financial returns, investors often consider inflation, which is a rise in prices that decreases buying power. Investors measure financial returns to stay ahead of inflation so their money will be worth more. For example, if an investment pays 3% a year but the inflation rate is 4% a year, the investment has lost worth. The financial return is less than the rate of inflation. When measuring financial returns, investors usually do not consider turnover, compliance, or utility.

.75. Beta is the measure of a security's price movement relative to the overall market. If the market overall is up 12 percent and a particular stock is up just 9 percent over the same period of time, the beta is .75 (9 divided by 12). Beta values greater than 1 indicate a stock that is more responsive than the market. Over this period of time, this security was less responsive than the market.

Increasing the cost of goods sold and decreasing taxable income. The LIFO method of inventory means that recent goods produced or purchased are the first goods sold. As a result, cost of goods sold reflects current costs, not the cost of older, lower-priced inventory that is counted under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. In periods of rising costs due to inflation, this increases cost of goods sold, thereby decreasing taxable income rather than decreasing the cost of goods sold and increasing taxable income, increasing both cost of goods sold and taxable income, or decreasing both cost of goods sold and taxable income.

Convertible securities are not necessarily high risk or low cost. Negotiable is a characteristic of checks that can be cashed at any time.

Consider the demand for the business's product. Tax preparation businesses often hire additional employees when they expect demand to increase for their products. When a company expects higher sales, it needs to increase its outputs, and therefore, needs more inputs (e.g., personnel) to satisfy the higher product demand. Tax preparation businesses do not need to obtain government application forms to hire employees. The business may not ask current employees to increase their workloads because they may not have the necessary skills to perform the job. Once the business determines that there is a need to hire an employee, the business can advertise the position in the newspaper for outside candidates.

One type of misconduct is insubordination, which involves disregarding authority, not following the rules, and public criticism. Employees who behave in this manner and who refuse to correct their behavior when it is brought to their attention, may be legally terminated on the grounds of misconduct. Mutiny involves disobeying orders at sea. Employees may be terminated for unsatisfactory performance, which involves not completing tasks according to set standards. Discrimination is unfair treatment of a person or a group based on the person's or group's characteristics.

Telling Susan to work or to solve the problem with the help of coworkers would not be acceptable ways of handling the complaint.

This movement affects businesses because the types of estate planning services they sell and the way they sell them will change. Lifestyle, consumption, and behavior are not population trends; however, these factors also affect how estate planning businesses market their goods and services.

Competitive-bid. Placing orders through the use of a competitive-buying method involves sending specifications for products to several vendors who respond with written quotes. Then, the business reviews the quotes and decides which vendor most closely meets the specifications. The specifications might include quality of product, delivery time, and price. This process is time consuming but often provides businesses with vendors that are able to provide exactly what the businesses want. The blank-check buying method involves giving certain vendors the authority to deliver products without first quoting a price. The lowest-price method involves always buying from the low bidder without considering other specifications. Standard-markup is not a buying method.

$1,250. Banks are often able to control variable expenses by making changes in the types of supplies they purchase. For example, it may be less expensive to buy plastic cups rather than paper cups to provide beverages to customers. To determine the savings in this situation, first calculate how many thousands there are in 5 million by dividing 5 million by 1,000 (5,000,000 ÷ 1,000 = 5,000). Then, multiply that number by the per thousand price for paper cups (5,000 x $3.75 = $18,750) and also by the per thousand price for plastic cups (5,000 x $3.50 = $17,500). Subtract the cost of plastic cups from the cost of paper cups to determine the amount of savings ($18,750 - $17,500 = $1,250).

Determining when to buy. Retailers need to know how much time it will take to obtain new merchandise to avoid running out of goods. To do this, they first calculate the length of time it takes to process a purchase order and send it to a vendor. Then, they calculate the length of time it takes the vendor to deliver the order. By adding the times, retailers can determine when they need to buy to prevent running out of goods. For example, perhaps a retailer knows that it takes the buying department four days to process a purchase order and two days for the vendor to receive the order. Then, it takes the vendor seven days to deliver the order. By adding these times (4 + 2 + 7 = 13), the retailer knows that it needs to order at least 13 days before it expects to run out of merchandise. Vendors usually arrange transportation. Retailers do not calculate the length of time it takes to process a purchase and the length of time it takes for a vendor to deliver the order to plan merchandise or prepare to count inventory.

Customer seems to be in a hurry. The service approach is a polite question that indicates the salesperson's willingness to be of service to the customer. This type of approach is effective when the customer seems to be in a hurry. In that situation, the salesperson is offering to help the customer now. The greeting or welcome approach is appropriate if the salesperson is busy with another customer, or if the salesperson is creating a friendly atmosphere. The merchandise approach is appropriate if the customer is examining a specific item.

Yes, but . . . . The yes, but . . . method allows the salesperson to acknowledge the objection tactfully without directly contradicting the customer. The toss-it-back method is used to turn the customer's objection into a valid reason for buying. The deny it method seeks simply to correct wrong information. The point-counterpoint method allows you to agree on a valid point made by a customer and then to answer by offering an equal or superior point.

Real estate agent. Some clients are interested in investing in land so financial planners need to have the necessary information to help them make informed decisions. A good source of information is a real estate agent who specializes in the type of investment that clients want. For example, some agents specialize in commercial property while others specialize in the home market. These agents have current information about the value of land, if the market is growing or declining, and fair market value. A financial planner would not obtain information about land investments from a trust attorney, a general contractor, or a building inspector.

Sell stored-value cards. Some financial institutions sell stored-value cards, which are similar to prepaid credit cards except that they are reloadable. For example, a customer planning a vacation might place $1,000 on a stored-value card. The card works the same as a credit card except that funds are deducted from a set balance. The advantage to the customer is that additional value may be added to the card. Selling stored-value cards is an auxiliary transaction because it is not the main focus of the financial institution. Most financial institutions operate ATM machines as a service to customers. Providing mortgage loans and handling direct deposits are the primary activities of many financial institutions.

Planning. Planning includes deciding what will be done and how it will be accomplished. Managers begin the planning process by determining the goals and objectives they want the business to achieve. Organizing is setting up the way the business's work will be done. Staffing is finding workers for the business, and controlling is monitoring the quantities being produced as well as the efficiency of production.

Investors. A business plan is a set of procedures or strategies that outlines how a person plans to take an idea and turn it into an organized effort to produce and/or distribute goods and services. Some people who start businesses do not have enough money to start out, so they seek financial assistance through lenders (e.g., banks) or private investors. The investors usually want to see a detailed business plan before investing money into a venture. A business owner does not distribute his/her business plan to competitors, clients, or promoters to obtain financial support.
