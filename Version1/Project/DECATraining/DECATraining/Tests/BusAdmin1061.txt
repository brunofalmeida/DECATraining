Reading. The first step in applying written directions to achieve tasks usually involves reading the
directions. Employees need to understand the written directions before they can apply them. Therefore,
reading for understanding and meaning is an important step. Employees should listen if the directions are
given verbally rather than in writing. If employees do not understand the written directions, they might
speak to a manager and ask questions for clarification. However, they should first read the directions.

Employee handbook. Businesses often develop employee handbooks that provide information about
their general policies and procedures. For example, a business might outline overtime and vacation
policies, disciplinary and grievance procedures, pay schedules, dress codes, and behavioral expectations
in its employee handbook. Employee handbooks are usually given to new employees when they first start
their jobs. Productivity manuals, customer newsletters, and personnel records are not sources that
workers use to obtain information about a company's general policies and procedures for employees.

 4. A
Ask questions. Before employees can follow directions, they must understand them. Therefore, asking
questions is important because supervisors do not always give directions in a clear and concise manner.
If employees are not sure of what is expected, they should ask. Taking the time to completely understand
the directions will help employees to do the work correctly and efficiently. Reviewing notes may not be
helpful if employees have written down incorrect directions. Employees are not expected to do the
research; researching is the responsibility of supervisors. Before employees can practice tasks, they
need accurate directions.

Respect of coworkers. Being able to listen effectively is an important skill in the world of work. Employees
who listen to others and try to understand what they are saying usually are able to respond appropriately.
The benefit is that they earn the respect of coworkers because they take the time to try to truly
understand what others are saying. As a result, they are able to answer questions, complete job
assignments correctly, and assist coworkers when necessary. Being able to listen effectively might lead
to a promotion but does not guarantee it. Being able to listen effectively does not necessarily mean that
employees will have access to management. Employees who listen effectively often have more
responsibility rather than fewer assignments.

them. Tempo is the rate of speed or rhythm the speaker uses. Economy of speech is using as few words
as possible to express an idea. Accuracy refers to the correctness of the message.

 7. B
Empathetic. Being empathic is acting according to an intellectual identification with the thoughts, feelings,
values, attitudes, and/or actions of another person. It is often helpful to imagine yourself in your friend's
place, to try to understand how s/he feels. By doing so, you often gain insight and can better help your
friend by providing thoughtful advice. If you are too formal, judgmental, or businesslike with a friend, you
may come across as uncaring, and you may offend your friend.

Others may have different opinions. When defending their ideas, employees should keep in mind that
others might not agree with the ideas or may have different opinions. If this happens, employees need to
remain objective and clearly explain their ideas and provide supporting information. Being calm and
logical is often the best way to defend ideas to others who have different opinions. Managers usually ask
questions because they want to clarify information and make sure they understand the ideas. Employees'
objectively defending their ideas usually does not result in office conflict. If employees understand their
ideas, it should not be difficult to explain the data.

Being a good listener requires active listening skills. In order to be a good listener while handling
telephone calls, you need to learn to shut out distractions, put aside what you are working on, and focus
on what the speaker is saying. This is not a natural skill, but it is one that can be learned through
practice. There will still be times when, no matter how carefully you listen, you will have to ask questions.

Mind-mapping programs. Mind-mapping computer programs help individuals organize a lot of information
in a meaningful way. Some web sites, such as Bubbl.us and Mindmeister, provide mind-mapping
programs free of charge. After mapping out the information in a logical order, the writer can then prepare
the report in a clear, understandable way. Index cards are manual tools for organizing information.
Statistical applications record numerical data. Online survey services (e.g., SurveyMonkey.com) allow
users to prepare, distribute, and analyze online questionnaires.

Regards. A closing is the point in which the writer ends a letter with a word of farewell just before signing
his/her name. When writing business letters, closings are usually neutral, professional, and friendly.
Closings such as "regards" and "sincerely" are common ways to end business letters. THX is an
initialism that represents the word thanks. Initialisms are not appropriate to use to close formal business
letters. A writer might use "greetings" to open an informal letter and use "affectionately" to close a letter
to a friend, family member or significant other.

Come right to the point. The opening paragraph of a business letter should explain the reason for writing
and come right to the point. Effective business letters do not waste the reader's time by providing a lot of
unnecessary information, but they immediately come to the point and capture the reader's attention. The
letter does not need to be formal, but it should contain specific details and have personal appeal for the
reader.

To sell products. One reason why businesses write informational messages is to sell products to
customers. Businesses often develop sales letters that explain their goods and services and send these
letters to prospective or current customers. The sales letters include important information about the
business and its products and are intended to encourage customers to buy. Letters and memos are types
of informational messages. Businesses identify customers before sending them informational messages.

 15. D
Letters of inquiry. The function of a letter of inquiry usually is to make a request. Businesspeople often
write letters of inquiry to request an appointment with a current customer, a potential customer, or a
business associate, particularly if those people are located out of town. For example, a businessperson
might write several letters requesting appointments with various customers before arranging a sales trip.
Persuasive messages are intended to encourage others to take action rather than to make a request.
Sales letters are a type of persuasive message. Corporate memorandums are internal forms of
communication.

Staff. Messages for all employees are considered staff communication. This is a form of downward
communication in which information is presented to employees by management. Upward communication
occurs when employees present information to management. Informal communication is the unofficial
exchange of information among members of an organization. Lateral, or horizontal, communication
involves the exchange of information between employees on the same level.

Gathers necessary information. Before the meeting takes place, Sam should gather information and
prepare notes for the meeting, so that he can provide necessary input or feedback that his supervisor has
requested. If Sam attends the meeting and does not have the correct information, he may lose credibility
with his supervisor and coworkers in terms of his job performance. Having handouts for meeting
participants and obtaining feedback from others may not be necessary for Sam to provide. Minutes are a
formal method of note taking that document the discussion, vote taking, and problem resolution that
occur during the meeting. A specific person usually writes the minutes during the meeting.

Courtesy from salespeople. Many customers don't complain about the treatment they receive, but they
don't return to the business to shop. A lack of parking, advertised items, or customer-service personnel
could also be detrimental to a business, but they are not likely to have as much impact on the customer
as an encounter with a rude or indifferent salesperson.

Greater profits. Businesses that provide good customer service usually retain their current customers.
Since it is much less costly to retain current customers than to find new ones, greater profits are usually
the result. Publicity is any nonpersonal presentation of goods, services, or ideas that is not paid for by the
company which benefits from it. Assets are anything of value that the business owns. Season is a certain

Customers' confidence in the business increases. Customers' confidence in a business grows when the
business provides accurate answers to their product questions. They feel the sales staff are
knowledgeable, which also gives customers more confidence in the products they buy. Customers are
less likely to need to return products when their questions about those products have been answered,
and their total purchases are more likely to increase than decrease. Customers may need to ask fewer
questions when their inquiries are handled in an effective manner.

Treat customers fairly. Management establishes policies that help employees to deal with customers in
the same way for the same situation in order to be fair. Customers who are not treated fairly may take
their business elsewhere. Businesses do not develop policies to treat customers differently, to offer
special privileges, or to give personal favors.

By identifying the customer's real needs. Product-related complaints often occur when customers make
improper buying decisions. Salespeople should try to identify the customer's real needs so that s/he can
suggest the most appropriate product. High-pressure selling techniques are never recommended and
would likely cause complaints. Salespeople may not be able to advise from personal experience in all
cases, and their advice may not be appropriate for the particular customer. Approaching customers
promptly is a good idea but will not prevent them from having product-related complaints.

Thorough knowledge of the products. Employees have the most contact with customers and are the ones
who often project the image of the company. Employees can reinforce a positive image by having
thorough knowledge of the business's products so they can effectively explain the products to customers.
Well-informed employees are able to answer questions correctly and reassure customers that they are
making the right buying decision. On the other hand, poorly-informed employees project a negative
image because they do not have a thorough knowledge of the products. Employees do not reinforce the
company's image by having comfortable work stations, generous pay and benefit plans, or full access to
customer databases.

Scarce. Resources, goods, and services that are available in limited quantities have more value than
those items that are plentiful. A scarcity creates more demand and also a higher price. For example, a
small wheat harvest would increase the price of bread. Resources, goods, and services that are
abundant, inexpensive, and unlimited are readily available and, therefore, less valued.

Demand. Demand is the quantity of a good or service that buyers are ready to buy at a given price at a
particular time. Producers try to balance supply with demand so that neither a surplus nor a shortage will
occur. Supply is the quantity of a good or service that sellers are able and willing to offer for sale at a
specified price in a given time period. Cost of production is the total expenses associated with producing
a product. Standard of living is the quality of life and general conditions to which people are accustomed.

Undeveloped. Traditional economic systems are found only in undeveloped countries where there is little
or no government involvement in either the production or the allocation of goods and services. In a
traditional system, people produce what they can, and everything is consumed. Industrial and established
countries have more complicated economic systems that may involve government regulations,
competition, or free enterprise. Independent countries include all countries that are self-governed.

Poverty. Private enterprise is the most productive economic system the world has ever known, but it does
have some disadvantages. Property and income are not distributed equally, and poverty has not been
eliminated. There are still many people who are not able to afford the basic necessities of life because
they hold low-paying jobs or are unemployed. The private enterprise system promotes competition,
freedom, and profit.

Profit motive. The profit motive is the hope of making a profit that serves as an incentive for individuals to
assume risks involved in investing in business. It is a goal toward which an individual or a business can
work. Competition is the rivalry among two or more businesses to attract scarce customer dollars. Private
property is anything of value that is owned by an individual or a business. Supply and demand work
together to determine prices.

Price and nonprice. Most businesses use a combination of price and nonprice competition. For example,
a business is using price competition when it advertises a special sale. It is using nonprice competition
when it advertises its delivery service. When the business uses the two together, it is combining price
and nonprice competition. A business advertising a special sale and delivery service is not using a
combination of direct and indirect, perfect and monopolistic, or local and national competition.

Most businesses try to increase productivity. Increased productivity provides greater profits for the
business and enables it to compete more effectively. Businesses can increase productivity in several
ways, such as providing updated equipment, training employees, and paying fair wages. Productivity is
important to a business and can be measured in a variety of ways. One way is to measure the monetary
value of work produced. Reduced productivity would probably mean higher prices.

Interests. Interests are the things that a person is curious about, concerned for, or involved with. When
assessing their personal strengths and weaknesses, people often identify their interests because
interests are strong points that might lead to appropriate occupations. For example, an individual works
on the school newspaper, likes to create posters for upcoming events, and belongs to the English club.
These interests are this person's strengths. After assessing personal strengths and weaknesses,
individuals might select suitable careers. Assessing personal strengths and weaknesses does not involve
identifying benefits or risks.

other with a bow rather a handshake, while others may hug when they meet. Being sensitive to such
differences enables businesspeople to succeed in a global market. Economic nationalism is a type of

people have different personal beliefs, values, or experiences. Intangible and specific are not types of

Levels of stress. Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension. Adaptability is
the ability to adjust or modify attitudes and/or behavior to new situations or circumstances. When people
are not willing to adapt to new situations, they often feel higher levels of stress. Fighting or ignoring new
circumstances can increase stress, which can harm a person's health and well-being. Resisting change
does not necessarily affect an individual's ability to reason or use logic. When a person learns how to
adapt to change, s/he may feel content or a sense of accomplishment by accepting the change. Being
adaptable often helps a person to relax, which can facilitate creative thinking and learning.

Airline ticket. Many lending institutions and retailers offer credit cards, which allow individuals or
businesses to purchase now and pay later. Because credit-card holders often pay high interest rates and
other fees, they must be careful when using their credit cards so they don't charge more than they can
pay off in a reasonable timeframe. Using credit cards to make large-dollar purchases often makes it
easier to change or cancel transactions such as airfare. In fact, many businesses prefer credit cards as a
payment method. Using a credit card to purchase a pack of gum, a magazine, or a small pizza is not a
good idea, especially if the transaction fee is higher than the price of the good or service.

Immediate gratification. Opportunity cost is the benefit that is lost when a person decides to use scarce

(benefit) is having money available for the future. The cost of placing money in the bank means that the
person does not have the money to purchase a desired item. When a person purchases something that
s/he doesn't need but really wants, the benefit to the person is immediate gratification or a sense of
instant satisfaction that s/he has acquired the desired product. The opportunity cost (benefit lost) is not a
higher discretionary income, lower salary or wages, or long-term dissatisfaction.

Protects against financial loss. Insurance is a contractual agreement in which one company (insurer) will
pay for specified losses incurred by the other company (insured) in return for installment payments
(premium). For example, a company that loses its inventory and equipment in a fire can file a claim with
its property insurance carrier to obtain money to purchase new inventory and equipment if the policy
premiums are up-to-date and the policy covers such losses. Insurance does not necessarily reduce a
business's security needs, lower personal tax obligation, or enhance economic utility.

Variances. Businesses analyze their financial information to determine the differences between what they
had forecast and what actually happened. By doing this, they can account for those differences and
improve future forecasts. In this scenario, equipment costs were not a factor. The business could not
determine from its financial information whether the supply of raw materials decreased or demand
increased. Forecasts are estimates based on information known at the time the forecast was made and
will not be exactly what actually happens. In this scenario, therefore, the variances would not be
considered forecasting errors.

Performance evaluations. Human resources management is the process of planning, staffing, leading,
and organizing the employees of a business. An important aspect of human resources management is
coordinating performance evaluations with employees and their supervisors. A performance evaluation is
a formal assessment by the supervisor of an employee's job performance that lets the employee know
how s/he is doing on the job. The human resources department keeps the performance assessment form
in the employee's personnel file. Sales promotions are coordinated by the business's promotion function.

Information that is needed. Information is a collection of facts, statistics, or data. Before businesses can
use the information, they must determine the type of information that is needed. For example, does a
business need economic data because it wants to expand, or does it need marketing data because it
wants to attract new customers? The business must decide the type of information it needs before it can
obtain and use that data. Businesses do not need to determine the type of computer system to purchase,
the type of report that is required, or the type of collection process to develop before using relevant data.

A technical-trends report that was written on February 5, 2011. An important factor to consider when
evaluating information is its timelines. If an article or report was published a long time ago, the
information may not be relevant or accurate anymore, particularly if the topic involves technology.
Because the technical-trends report was written recently, the information is likely to be up-to-date. Due to
technology, the world is constantly experiencing medical breakthroughs and changes; therefore, a journal
article that was published a decade (10 years) ago is less likely to contain up-to-date information. Stock
values change rapidly, so a stock table that appeared in a newspaper on January 14, 2010 would not
contain the most current information about stock values. Because the world's history has dramatically
changed since 2000, the history textbook is outdated.

Request for proposal. Complex projects often require the expertise of external resources. Building a new
facility requires skills from architects, construction companies, electricians, etc. And because these types
of projects are expensive, companies want to obtain bids from the potential vendors or contractors to
determine which one is best suited to perform the work. A request for proposal (RFP) is an invitation for
potential vendors to present bids to obtain a contract and perform the work. Because the work is
complex, the RFP must include specific information and provide detailed instructions about the way the
proposal should be written. Often, an RFP will require potential vendors to provide a summary of
qualifications as a section of the proposal. A business plan is a company's blueprint for success—its
business model. An executive summary is an element of a business plan and provides and overview of
the most important information.

Makes it easier to comparison shop. The continuing growth of the Internet (e-commerce) allows
consumers to log onto their computers and visit several web sites to compare products and prices. This
makes comparison shopping easier because consumers do not need to telephone or drive to multiple
businesses to obtain the desired product information. The Internet benefits businesses because it allows
them to promote their products on their web sites. Another way that the Internet affects businesses is that
it often reduces the need to use intermediaries to get the products to the end users. Because there is so
much information available through the Internet, people may suffer from information overload, which is a
disadvantage of the Internet.

Manage their time. Many employees use electronic calendars to keep track of their activities and prepare
schedules. The benefit of using these devices is that it allows employees to manage their time because
they can keep a schedule of their activities. They know what they have to do at a certain time on a certain
date, such as attend a meeting. They can also list deadlines for projects. This enables them to plan the
use of free time in order to accomplish their assigned responsibilities. Employees do not use an
electronic calendar to communicate with coworkers or delegate tasks. Employees use electronic
calendars to keep track of deadlines; however, managers usually determine the deadline based on the
priority of the project.

Sort by zip code. Database software programs allow businesses to arrange customer information

Database sharing. Groupware applications refer to the modes that employees who work in different
locations use to work together or collaborate so they can accomplish a common goal. One mode of
collaboration is sharing a database that links or networks several people via computer. For example,
when both a sales representative and a warehouse manager have the ability to turn on their computers
and access the same inventory status information to see if a product is in stock for a customer, they are
using a groupware application. E-mail filters are computer programs that block out unwanted information.

Report workplace accidents. Certain governmental agencies have developed health and safety
regulations that businesses are expected to follow in order to provide employees with a safe work
environment. These regulations usually require businesses to report workplace accidents to the
appropriate agency. The purpose of this requirement is to identify and correct unsafe working conditions,
and to compensate workers who have been injured on the job. Health and safety regulations usually do
not require businesses to inspect office facilities, hold regular safety meetings, or purchase fireproof
supplies. However, safety-conscious businesses usually inspect their facilities to identify potential safety
hazards. Also, businesses often hold regular safety meetings to keep employees informed.

the problem is. Because the safe was open, the office was in disarray, and a computer was missing, the
business was probably robbed. In case the robber is still in the building, Josh should leave the business
immediately and seek a safe environment. Then, following company procedures, Josh should notify his
supervisor or the local law enforcement authorities (police). Josh should call the fire department if a fire
occurs. The local health department handles issues associated with health risks. The owner should file a
claim with the business's insurance company after the robbery has been reported to the appropriate lawenforcement
authorities.

Increased risk of theft. Businesses establish different types of security procedures to protect their
assets—equipment, inventory, facilities, money, information, and employees. Businesses need to
communicate these security procedures to employees so the employees know what they need to do to
maintain a secure work environment. If employees do not follow security procedures, the risk of security
breaches occurring increases. For example, an employee who does not properly lock the cash drawer
increases the risk of robbery. If employees fail to lock the warehouse doors at the end of business hours,
the risk of theft increases. If a security breach occurs, the business may experience financial losses (e.g.,
stolen money, goods, and equipment). Employees follow safety procedures to reduce the risk of
accidents in the workplace. Financial losses may decrease if businesses train their employees about
ways in which they can identify counterfeit paper money at the point of sale.
