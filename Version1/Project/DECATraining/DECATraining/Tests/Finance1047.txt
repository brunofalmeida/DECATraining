1. A
Ability to pay. The relationship between a creditor and a debtor is usually based on the debtor's ability to
pay the creditor the amount that is owed. Businesses offer credit to increase sales; however, they expect
customers to repay the debt. Therefore, creditors usually base their decision to offer credit to those who
they believe have the ability to pay. Creditors establish a billing schedule and pricing method. They also
determine the type of account to offer debtors. These factors do not influence the relationship.

Sole proprietorship. Other advantages of a sole proprietorship are that it is easy to start, it has certain tax
advantages, and the details of the business can be kept private. In a partnership, the profits are divided
among the partners who sometimes disagree as to how profits should be divided. In a corporation, the
profits are divided among the stockholders. The officers of the corporation are responsible for the actual
operation and management of the firm. A joint venture is an arrangement that involves two or more
businesses entering into a relationship by combining complementary resources, such as technology,
skills, capital, or distribution channels, for the benefit of all parties.

3. B
A senior manager tells a stakeholder that the government did not approve a new product because it did
not meet safety standards. When a group of people have access to non-public information (material
information) and make trades based on this knowledge, they have an unfair advantage over others. If the
insider (senior manager) gives this information to others (stakeholders) so they can make trades based
on the knowledge, both parties could be prosecuted for insider trading. In the example, the company's
stock values are likely to be affected by the problems with a new product. When an employee shares
material information with a person outside the company and who can act on the knowledge before it is
revealed to the general public, it is an example of illegal insider trading. On the other hand, officers and
board members of a company who buy or sell their own company's securities, and report the trades to
the SEC, are not conducting illegal insider trading activities. Advising customers about mortgage rates,
giving financial advice to a client, and providing an auditor with the company's material or financial
information are not examples of insider trading.

Oversees the registration process for initial public offerings (IPOs). The SEC is the administrative agency
that enforces securities regulations. The SEC works to ensure public companies fully disclose their
financial information to investors and to protect the public from fraudulent activities related to the
securities market. One function of the SEC is to oversee the registration process for corporations when
they first offer stock to the public, which is called initial public offerings or IPOs. The SEC does not
distribute dividends or sell securities. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board oversees the
auditing processes of the public corporations' financial statements.

Corrective. Corrective controls are initiatives taken to fix a problem that has already been detected. Hiring
a compliance officer to monitor financial processes is a corrective action because someone had already
detected data inconsistencies. Preventative controls involve actions to keep something from happening
before it occurs. Product controls are activities the business uses to manage the processes, quality, and
quantity of goods and services. Conditional controls allow certain actions to occur within a specific set of
circumstances.

7. D
Detect compliance inconsistencies across different jurisdictions. Businesses use compliance software to
aid them in detecting financial transaction problems. Because interstate and international commerce
involves following different regulations in different locations, advanced compliance technologies can scan
or audit the data to ensure their compliance with different jurisdictions' regulations and rules. The
purpose of compliance software is not to evaluate a competitor's compliance, correct human-resource
problems, or improve product quality and satisfaction levels.

To identify similar transactions. Comparative reasoning identifies and compares similar transactions and
information. By identifying similarities in transactions, the business can conduct further research to
determine if or how the transactions are related and if a problem exists, such as a single transaction
having multiple entries. The temporal reasoning process evaluates the timing of financial transactions.
Contextual reasoning is used to consider each financial transaction's circumstances and how it compares
to historical patterns in the system. Businesses do not use comparative-reasoning processes to boost
data storage systems.

Listening. In order to carry out their supervisors' instructions satisfactorily, employees must understand
those instructions correctly. This means that active listening is a necessary skill. Good speaking skills are
also important in business but not as important to carrying out instructions as listening well. Giving
feedback, or expressing an opinion, is not always a job requirement. Using the grapevine would involve
circulating information that the business has not formally announced.

intent, people can communicate how they feel through their choice of words. The words that people use
often express their interest and enthusiasm. A key element of verbal communication is listening.

To make the message more convincing. Messages usually are more persuasive if they are supported by
logical evidence. Logical evidence is based on fact rather than on opinion. If businesses are writing
persuasive messages to encourage customers to do something, such as buy a product, they should
include logical evidence to make the message more convincing. Logical evidence is factual, however, it
may not be interesting. Strong language may offend the recipient rather than help to explain the idea.
Logical evidence is intended to be persuasive. It does not force the recipient to respond.

Cash flow. When businesses save excess money, they have more cash available to cover unexpected
expenses or to invest. Saving money has a positive effect on a business's cash flow which determines
the amount of cash the business has to work with at any given time. The more money that is saved, the
more cash is available. Interest rate is the percentage figure used in calculating interest charges.
Accounts receivable are all monies owed to a firm by its customers. Debt is the amount of money a

Obtain short-term capital. Businesses can make either short-term or long-term investments. Short-term
investments are those that a business holds for less than one year. Some businesses make short-term
investments to generate capital in a short amount of time. They might need short-term capital to finance
special projects or to expand the business. For example, a business invests $100,000 in a stock that is
appreciating in value by 15% annually. The business can sell the stock prior to the one-year point and
probably obtain the 15% increase which amounts to $15,000. Long-term wealth is capital that
accumulates over a period of several years. Businesses do not hold investments for less than one year to
reduce tax obligations or control inflation rates.

Rule induction. Data mining is the process of searching computer databases to look for patterns and
relationships among information. The data question or problem determines what data-mining approach
the business should use. The rule induction approach involves the use of "ifthen" rules or scenarios
to mine or obtain data. To use this approach, the business must determine the sets of circumstances to
use to obtain results. For example, a mortgage company may want to determine the probability or odds
of customers earning a certain salary defaulting on a $200,000 mortgage. The neural networking
approach uses computer applications that mimic the ways in which the human brain processes data,
which often involve sequencing data patterns. Decision trees involve categorizing or segmenting data
into meaningful, related groups based on certain characteristics that are defined by the set of rules
(criteria) that the business establishes. The fuzzy logic approach uses broad or vague concepts to set
rules, such as "high" or "low."

Export. The export function allows the user to output or transmit data to another database, spreadsheet,
or file format so another database or program can use the data. Many database programs (e.g., Access)
allow users to export data to a variety of supported databases, programs, and file formats. Replication is
a function that allows the user to create two or more copies of an Access database. The conversion
function allows the user to save the data in the existing database in another version of the database
program. A filter is a set of criteria that is used to retrieve a subset of data or to sort the data.

Auditing. Shareholders and prospective shareholders make investment decisions by reviewing the
financial information that public corporations provide. For this reason, it is important for the corporation to
accurately report its financial position so investors can make appropriate decisions based on correct
information. The auditing process involves reviewing the financial information to ensure that it is accurate,
meets legal requirements, and is presented in the correct format before releasing it to the general public.
Batch processing involves moving groups of data accounts from one area to another (e.g., pending to
complete) at certain intervals. Planning is the management function of deciding what will be done and
how it will be accomplished. Smoothing involves offering customers a discount for purchasing products
that otherwise would go to waste.

The federal government. Governments require businesses to provide certain types of financial

ensure that the corporation is in compliance.

Use the information to make financial decisions. Accounting is the process of keeping and interpreting
financial records. The finance function is responsible for obtaining funds and managing the business's
money in ways that achieve the business's goals. The financial records that are maintained and prepared
by the accounting function are analyzed by the finance function of the business, which uses the
information to make decisions about how to achieve the business's goals. Adjusting journal entries,
tracking accounts receivable, and calculating ratios (e.g., equity) are tasks carried out by a business's
accounting department.

64. A
The managerial accounting system is useful for planning and internal decision making. Businesses use
managerial accounting systems for internal use. These systems help managers plan, control resources,
and make decisions for various segments of the company. For example, the managerial accounting
system often involves obtaining financial information to determine if the business should order more
goods for inventory or if it should hire additional production workers. The government requires
businesses to use the financial accounting system to report their financial positions to external users. The
financial accounting system involves reporting financial information in certain ways by applying the
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The government does not require businesses to use
managerial accounting systems, so the ways in which managerial accounting systems obtain and use
information are flexible.

Follow accounting standards such as GAAP or IFRS. Because businesses must use the financial
accounting system to prepare financial information for external audiences (i.e., shareholders and
government agencies), the information must be presented in a consistent way. The generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) are currently used by most accountants in the U.S. to ensure that they
prepare financial reports in a consistent manner. However, much of the rest of the world uses the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to prepare and report financial information. Use of the
financial accounting system is a government requirement rather than a way for the business to establish
credibility. Businesses do not need to attach copies of all transaction receipts to reports or forms;
however, receipts and documentation must be available for review if the government requests or requires
it for an additional audit. Financial data registration guidelines are a fictitious term.

Customers' invoices. By reviewing invoices on an ongoing basis, a business is often able to identify sales
trends. For example, lower invoice totals over a period of time indicate that the business is not generating
the same levels of revenue and profit as it did during previous periods. Lower revenues and profits may
require the business to revise its budget. The business will need to determine why it is experiencing
lower sales, which may include an economic downturn, customer-service issues, product quality, etc., so
it can take corrective action. Cash outflows are the monies that flow out of the business (expenses).
Liquidity ratios are formulas that help a business determine how quickly it can pay off its short-term
debts. A break-even analysis is a financial analysis that is used to identify the level of sales needed to
reach the break-even point at various prices.

Comparative balance sheet. A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial condition
of the business at that particular moment. Businesses often integrate their balance sheets from previous
time periods into one balance sheet so they can compare data to detect changes and identify trends.
This document is often called a comparative balance sheet. The consumer price index, stock tables, and
customer credit reports are external sources of financial information.

Credit standards. Businesses establish standards or criteria for determining to whom they should extend
credit. Businesses consider many factors such as the customer's credit history, credit score, income, type
of purchase, etc. If the customer meets the company's credit standards, Tom is more likely to approve
the customer's request for a line of credit. The company's purchasing policies, accounting method, and
payment history are not factors that Tom needs to consider when determining if the company should offer
the customer a line of credit.

Cash-flow statement. The cash-flow statement is a financial summary that contains estimates as to
when, where, and how much money will flow into and out of a business. Analyzing the cash-flow
statement will help a business determine if it will have enough money coming in to pay its short-term
expenses. The business plan is the business's written business modelit describes how the business
will achieve its objectives. The capital-investment plan describes the business's assets and how the
business plans to use them over time. A mutual-funds statement is a status report sent to investors to let
them know how their mutual funds are performing.

Sales and investment income. Businesses earn income in a variety of ways, such as sales, rentals,
dividends, and accumulated interest. Changes in income affect a business's profitability. If the business's
profitability drops over time, then it might need to cut expenses. If the business's profitability increases,
the business might decide to expand or replace equipment. So, it is important for a business to
continuously monitor its sources of income. Insurance premiums are expenses. The depreciation rate is
the level at which the value of an asset (e.g., machinery) decreases over time.

Employee handbook. An employee handbook provides new employees with printed information about the
business that the employee can read and refer to when s/he has questions about the business.
Employee handbooks usually include basic information such as company history, hours of operation,

must be spent in orientation sessions. An exit interview is a discussion with an employee who is leaving

Search the Web. The World Wide Web (WWW) links millions of computers throughout the world by way
of the Internet. Obtaining information is one of the most common ways that businesses use the Web. For
example, a business in one state that wanted to locate a potential vendor in another state can search the
Web to find out if that vendor has posted information on its web page. Searching the Web is fast and
allows business employees to obtain vital information without leaving the office. In order to send an email
or fax a request, a business first needs to obtain an e-mail address or a fax number, which often are
listed on a web page. Phoning an agent would not necessarily provide a business with information about
new vendors.

and analyze numerical information. Although many word-processing applications have basic drawing
capabilities to produce simple graphics, the more complex graphic elements are generally created by
special graphics and design programs (e.g., Freehand).

Sales are expected to increase by 5%. Spreadsheet software programs allow businesses to use a
computer to perform accounting and other financial calculations. An advantage of using a spreadsheet
program is that a business can make various assumptions about sales and find out quickly what effect
they will have on its financial situation. For example, a business could change the level of sales by
different percentages, such as 5% or 10%, to find out the effect that would have on net income. The
spreadsheet program automatically does the calculations. Although keeping appointments might lead to
sales, a salesperson would be more likely to use a personal digital assistant (PDA) to track appointments
rather than a spreadsheet program. Mailing labels are generated with database programs. Database
programs are also used to track customers' purchases.

Business. The primary function of record keeping is to provide information that indicates the status of the

a business keeps are not designed to provide information about what is happening with the economy, the
country, or the industry. However, the business's records might reflect current economic or industry

Technology improvements. A trend is the general direction in which people or events are moving. To
compete in the marketplace, businesses must use technology. Technology can improve a business's
efficiency and productivity levels by making use of technological tools, such as machinery, computer
networks, and the media. Because technology is always changing, businesses must also change to
remain competitive. Economic conditions (e.g., unemployment rates, inflation, interest rates, business
growth) fluctuate and change and do not remain stable. Business and consumer buying motives are not
always predictable. Product classification is not a business trend that affects a business's efficiency and
productivity levels.

Financial. Resources are people or items that the business needs to accomplish an activity or project.
Financial resources provide money to pay workers and buy the goods and services that the business

To cut costs, the business might decide to use lower quality goods or make do with fewer supplies.
Human resources are the people who carry out the work. Intangible resources cannot be detected

to complete the project and how those resources will be used. The advantage to project planning is that

machine costs the business money because it must buy the postage in advance from the postal service.
In this example, three employees each take 39 cents of postage four times a week for a total of 12 times
(4 x 3 employees = 12) which amounts to $4.68 per week ($.39 x 12 = $4.68). Determine the yearly cost
