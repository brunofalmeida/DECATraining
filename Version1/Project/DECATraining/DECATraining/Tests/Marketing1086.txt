Within the scope of his/her employment. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer may be
held responsible for an employee's tort if the employee's wrongful or harmful actions are related to
his/her job. For example, if an employee causes an accident while driving the company's truck to deliver
an order, the company can be held liable for damages and injuries resulting from the accident. Although
the employer may not know about the accident at the time that it occurred, the employer is likely to be
held liable for the accident because the employee was acting on the employer's behalf. Wrongful actions
related to work may occur during or after normal working hours. Although the employee's wrongful
actions may be related to his/her emotional stress, the employer can still be held liable for the tort as long
as the action is related to the employee's job responsibilities.

They are stated orally or in writing. A contract involves making a promise to take a specific action.
Express contracts involve making promises to take action that are clearly stated either verbally or in
writing. Some contracts are not enforceable, such as a contract that is made with a child under the age of
18, or a contract that involves the performance of an illegal activity (e.g., theft). Unilateral agreements are
contracts that involve promises made by one party. Express contracts are not always unilateral
agreements.

Timeliness. Channel management is the process of coordinating channel members to move goods and
services to the end user. The way that a business manages its channel members impacts customerservice
levels. An important aspect of channel management in relation to customer service is making
sure that the customers receive their products in a timely manner. In many cases, customers order items
for a specific purpose and need them on a certain date. Therefore, it is important for the business to
monitor channel members' activities to ensure that the products are moving through the channel in the
most efficient manner. Taxes are monies that individuals or businesses must pay to the government.
Protectionism is a government's policy to protect domestic industries and businesses against foreign
competition. Advertising is any paid form of nonpersonal presentation of ideas, images, goods, or
services.

Producer to industrial user. Typically, industrial goods require installation or special servicing that
producers feel they are best qualified to provide. The producer to industrial user channel is, therefore, the
most efficient one for them to use. The involvement of intermediaries such as agents or industrial
distributors is not necessary. A retailer would not be part of industrial distribution.

Antitrust. A tying agreement is an illegal arrangement that occurs when a business requires a customer
to buy other products in order to obtain the goods and services that the customer really wants. To protect
individuals and businesses, many governments develop regulations known as antitrust laws that protect
individuals and businesses from unfair practices that restrain trade and competition. Probate laws involve
estate issues. Zoning laws regulate property uses. Infringement laws address intellectual property issues.

Distribution channels. Long-term commitments are made to channel members to insure reliable flow of
products to consumers. It is often difficult to change distribution channels without disrupting the flow of
goods. Price, promotion, or packaging have no impact on the consumer if the product is not available.
Target markets are the consumers and may change if the product changes. Market strategies are
designed to be adaptive to current market input.

Empathic. Being empathic is acting according to an intellectual identification with the thoughts, feelings,
values, attitudes, and/or actions of another person. It is often helpful to imagine yourself in your friend's
place, to try to understand how s/he feels. By doing so, you often gain insight and can better help your
friend by providing thoughtful advice. If you are too formal, judgmental, or businesslike with a friend, you
may come across as uncaring, and you may offend your friend.

Assertive manner. Assertiveness is the ability to express yourself; communicate your point of view; and
stand up for your rights, principles, and beliefs. Business employees who participate in group discussions
should present their ideas and opinions in an assertive manner so others will know exactly what they
think. Being assertive is an effective way to express your point of view in group discussions. Employees
should not be argumentative when participating in group discussions because the goal usually is to reach
some type of agreement. Employees usually do not present their ideas and opinions in a written format or
a nonverbal style when participating in group discussions.

Proofread the message for spelling and grammatical errors. Although many people view e-mail as an
informal method of communication, it is a vital communication tool in today's business world. Therefore, it
is important to maintain a professional tone when developing business-related e-mails. The text in a
professional e-mail should contain proper grammar and correct spelling. To ensure that the message
does not contain spelling and grammatical errors, the businessperson should proofread the message and
make necessary corrections before sending the message to the intended receiver. Only the most critical
e-mail messages should be sent as high priority messages. Capitalizing all of the letters in the text often
implies an angry tone, so this practice should be avoided. Although the subject line should be brief, it
should contain enough information for the message recipient to determine the message content. If the
subject line is too vague, the recipient may delete the message before reading it.

Memorandum. Memorandums are a frequently used form of brief, written communication exchanged by
people within a business. Memorandums often are distributed to employees within a business to update
them on the progress of various projects, or inform them of changes in policies and procedures. They are
informal and simple because they are intended only for the use of the business's employees. A proposal
usually is a complex written report that is formal and may be distributed to those outside the business.
Handbooks and newsletters are internal company publications but they are not memorandums.

Think about what they want to say before they say it. Employees should be able to express themselves
to their coworkers. However, they should always think about what they want to say before saying it so
that they do not cause problems or misunderstandings. Legitimate complaints or problems about the job
should be discussed with the supervisor, not coworkers. Rumors and gossip should not be passed on to
coworkers as they may not be true and could cause harm. A nondirective approach is best in
communicating with angry coworkers as it helps to defuse their anger.

Decrease in sales. Maintaining good customer/client relations is important to a business because
customers who receive poor treatment may never return to the business. When customers fail to return,
businesses often experience a decrease in sales. Also, customers who are poorly treated may tell their
friends and others about the treatment, and these people may decide not to buy from the business,
thereby adding to the decrease in sales. Failing to maintain positive customer/client relations probably
would not result in a loss of advertisers, a reduction in assets, or a lowering of goals.

Image of the business. Customers form an image of a business as they communicate with employees.
When employees cannot answer questions, customers receive a negative impression. The customer's
purchasing ability is determined by the amount of his/her disposable income or budget. The customer's
sourcing strategies are generally determined independent of a specific employee interaction. Price fixing
is an illegal activity in which a business charges different prices for similar amounts and types of
products.

Who makes the purchase. The difference between a consumer good or service and an industrial good or

in office work, it is an industrial good. If an individual buys an item for personal use, it is a consumer
good. How the purchase is made, the price of the purchase, and when the purchase is made are not
deciding factors in determining whether an item is a consumer or industrial good.

Increasing returns. When there are too few workers, they may not be able to handle resources well. So,
companies choose to add workers which makes everyone more efficient and productive. This is called
increasing returns. The company may continue to add workers, believing that output will continue to rise,
which is not the case. At some point, too many workers will again become inefficient, and although output
may still rise, it will be at a diminishing rate. This is known as diminishing returns. Marginal returns, return
on revenue, and return on input are all fictitious terms.

To maintain productivity. Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension.
Excessive stress can have a negative effect on employees, such as reducing productivity. When
employees feel stress, they may not work efficiently. Also, stress may cause employees to miss work
because of stress-related illnesses. To maintain productivity, many businesses develop activities and
programs that help employees reduce stress. For example, some businesses provide recreational
activities such as exercise programs during the work day. Some businesses provide quiet areas for
employees to relax or listen to music. The intention is to reduce stress so employees will remain healthy
and productive. Businesses do not develop programs and activities to help reduce employee stress to
encourage creativity, eliminate conflict, or exhibit empathy.

Test marketing. Test marketing is the process of introducing a new product to a limited market to
determine what its acceptance will be. During the test-marketing process, the business monitors the
product's sales to analyze demand and surveys customers to obtain their opinions about the product. If
the product is not accepted by the test market, the business may make changes to the product and retest
it later, or it may discontinue the product. If the product launch is unsuccessful, the business reduces the
risk of financial loss because the testing is done in a limited market rather than nationwide. Observation
involves gathering data by watching consumers. Surveys involve asking consumers questions to learn
their opinions and the reasons behind those opinions. A consumer panel is a group of consumers formed
for the purpose of discussing a specific topic, usually a good or service.

Simple. A simple sampling strategy is used when the researchers believe that the population is relatively
homogeneous for the characteristic of interest. In this case, the researchers would feel that people
sharing the same major, business, would have similar interests. Proportionate sampling is used when
subgroups vary dramatically in size in our population. Researchers can select more participants from
larger groups to ensure that they are adequately represented. Stratified random sampling is used when
subgroups in the population differ a great deal in their responses or behavior. To overcome this issue,
researchers treat the population as though it were multiple, separate populations and then randomly
sample within each subgroup. Marketers would choose cluster sampling when it would be impossible or
impractical to identify every person in the sample. As an example, imagine that a large international
business wants to survey its employees but does not have a staff directory from which names could be
sampled. It would be easier to sample by department. The researchers could randomly sample a
percentage of employees within each randomly selected department rather than trying to sample that
percentage of employees companywide.

Diaries record repetitive behaviors that occur at frequent intervals. When marketing researchers conduct
an ongoing study about certain behaviors, they often require the study's participants to keep a diary of
their various activities and habits. Diaries, which participants often keep for an extended period of time,
record information about commonly performed, repetitive activities such as eating, shopping, television
viewing, radio listening, etc. By recording this type of information over time, researchers can obtain
detailed information about customer buying habits, brand preferences, spending behavior, televisionviewing
habits, etc. Because some of the information that the researchers collect from diaries is
qualitative in nature, it is often a complex process to convert the data into statistical information for
tabulation.

What, if anything, did you like best about the last computer you purchased? This question gives
participants the option of indicating that they didn't like anything about their last computer rather than
forcing them to identify something positive about the computer even if they didn't feel positive about it.
Asking where participants bought their last computer equipment and software should be turned into two
separate questions since the participants might have purchased the computer equipment and software at
two different locations. By doing that, the researcher is addressing one issue at a time rather than asking
a question with a multiple focus. Asking participants what they liked best about their last computer
purchase is vague and needs to be rewritten. Does the researcher want to know about the purchasing
process or the computer, itself? Asking about purchasing a computer at a store surrounded by other
stores and lots of traffic is not neutrally stated since most customers do not care for lots of traffic. This
question, too, needs to be reworded so that it doesn't bias participant responses.

Assigning a numeric value. Coding is the process of assigning a numeric value to the various responses
on a marketing questionnaire or survey. Some questionnaires contain built-in codes such as when the
respondent is asked to rate agreement with a question on a scale of one to five. The numbers from one
to five are the numeric codes. For other types of questionnaires, researchers often establish a master
code. For example, there are six possible responses to a certain question and the third answer has a
numeric value of three, but that number is not printed on the questionnaire. Once the responses are
coded and individuals complete the questionnaire, researchers are able to tabulate the responses, rate
the agreement to each answer, and compute a total score.

activities should be aimed toward satisfying consumer wants and needs while achieving company goals.
Policies are general rules to be followed by company personnel. Risk is the possibility of loss or failure.

Use computer passwords to limit access to certain data. Businesses have the responsibility to protect
their customers' confidential information. One way to protect confidential information is to limit the access
to employees who need or use the information. Requiring qualified employees to use computer
passwords to access the confidential information can reduce the risk of unethical behaviorsuch as
snooping or spying. Anti-virus software, client-tracking capabilities, and a resignation request would not
prevent the employee from obtaining the information. The business would likely reprimand or fire the
employee for his/her unethical behavior after the incident occurred.

Manage their time. Many employees use electronic calendars to keep track of their activities and prepare
schedules. The benefit of using these devices is that it allows employees to manage their time because
they can keep a schedule of their activities. They know what they have to do at a certain time on a certain
date, such as attend a meeting. They can also list deadlines for projects. This enables them to plan the
use of free time in order to accomplish their assigned responsibilities. Employees do not use an
electronic calendar to communicate with coworkers or delegate tasks. Employees use electronic
calendars to keep track of deadlines; however, managers usually determine the deadline based on the
priority of the project.

Groupware. Groupware is specialized software that allows users to work on documents together, share
files, and communicate quickly and easily. While some groupware requires users to collaborate through
an intranet, much of today's groupware is Internet-based, allowing group members in multiple locations to
work together online. Many Web 2.0 tools such as Google Apps are groupware applications. Shareware
is essentially sample software. It gives consumers an opportunity to try software free-of-charge before
purchasing it. Because it is merely a sample, the shareware is likely to be limited in functionality or time.
Spyware is malicious software installed on computers to gather users' personal information. Freeware is
software available at no cost to consumers.

Unemployment rate. An environmental scan is an analysis of external forces that influence a business's
success. The fluctuation of unemployment rates is an economic factor because unemployment has an
effect on consumers' ability to buy goods and services. If consumers are unemployed, they do not have
income to spend. As a result, businesses do not sell as much because consumers are not buying. When
this situation occurs, businesses often reduce expenses in an attempt to stay in business until the rate of
employment starts to rise again. Increased regulation is a political factor. Population shift is a
demographic factor. Lifestyle adjustment is a cultural factor.

Aid decision making. Statistics are information presented in numerical form. For the statistics to be
useful, businesses must analyze and interpret them. Businesses often base business decisions on
statistical information. For example, a business may obtain statistical information that indicates a product
is not selling well. Based on the statistical information, the business may decide to phase out or stop
making the product. Or, if statistical information indicates that the demand for the product exceeds the
available supply of the product, the business may decide to increase production. Businesses use
promotional activities to influence people to buy their products. Although analyzing statistical information
might spark an employee's creativity (e.g., for problem-solving purposes), it is not a primary reason for
interpreting it.

Computerizing the purchasing function. Operations are the day-to-day activities required for continued
business functioning. One aspect of operations is the purchasing function which involves obtaining the
products for use in the business or for resale. Purchasing is important because employees need
materials and supplies to do their jobs. By computerizing the purchasing function, businesses are able to
place orders electronically, continually track the level of inventory so orders can be placed automatically,
and pay invoices by transferring funds electronically. This technology speeds up the purchasing process
and helps to make sure that needed materials and supplies are always available. Technology does not
automate the work force or organize a conveyor system. Robotics is a type of technology.

are injuries caused by stretching or tearing ligaments at a joint in the body. Common types of sprains
occur in ankles, fingers, wrists, and knees. Closed wounds are injuries in which the skin is not broken,
but the tissue underneath is damaged. Open wounds are injuries involving a break in the skin. Open

To plan for the unexpected. When identifying resources, it is important to be realistic. This often means
planning for the unexpected because it's not a good idea to assume that everything will go correctly.
Therefore, it is important to build in a safety net, or padding, in case something happens. For example,
allow a little more time in the event that project members need to deal with other activities. It is not a
good idea to try to cut corners and get by with less than you really need. Building in a safety net does not
involve finding substitutes or obtaining financial support.

Prepare a satisfaction survey. When a business completes a project for a customer, it is important to
involve the customer in the evaluation process to determine if the customer is satisfied with the results.
One technique to use is to prepare a satisfaction survey, and have the customer complete the survey and
include additional comments. For example, the survey might ask about the quality of work or the length of
time involved in completing the project. Customers can rate the project based on their expectations in
comparison to actual results. Customers often analyze a project proposal before hiring a business to
complete a project. A business organizes the management team and determines the contract criteria
before beginning a project.

Criteria. Criteria are the standards that businesses often establish in order to select vendors. Businesses
want to make sure that vendors will be able to provide the quality of product that is needed as well as
deliver it on time and for a reasonable price. For example, one criterion might be that a vendor is able to
provide repair service, if needed. Then, those vendors that do not have that capability will not be
considered. A purchase order is the form that a business fills out to order goods. Once a vendor accepts
a purchase order, it becomes a contract. Vendors usually prepare price sheets.

Sidewalks. Properly maintaining sidewalks is important to businesses because customers use them

customers and employees and presents an orderly image of the business. Fixtures, furniture, and

Traits such as initiative and commitment. A trait is a personal characteristic expressed by a regular

feel that applicants who have participated in internship programs exhibit initiative (motivation) and
commitment to carry out objectives and gain experience to help further their careers. Therefore, traits,
such as initiative and commitment, are valuable to employers because they generally want to hire
personnel who are committed and motivated in job-related tasks. Internships do not always provide
interns with experience in financial matters. A well-rounded education and sales contacts are not
personal traits.

too expensive to develop and produce, or if the needed materials are too scarce to obtain affordably. It is
too late by the time the product is already on the market (in the monitoring or elimination phases). Idea

Tracking visitors to their websites. As a result of computer technology, many businesses have developed
websites that are accessible to customers. The technology that allows businesses to have websites also
makes it possible for those businesses to track the visitors to their websites and obtain information about
them such as name, address, type of purchase, amount of sale, etc. Businesses often use this
information to improve their product/service mix. For example, if a business determines that customers
are not buying a certain product, they might improve the product or replace it. Businesses do not use
computer technology to mail questionnaires to customers. Businesses often compile the information they
obtain through their websites in databases. However, the information is not useful until the businesses
analyze it. Simply preparing interactive software programs will not help businesses to obtain information.

Natural resources that are needed to produce them. Because of continual advances in technology, some
products become obsolete very quickly. Some businesses plan for these products to become obsolete
quickly so they can sell new, updated versions. This is often considered an ethical issue because the use
of natural resources may be involved in producing goods that have a short life span. Many people believe
that it is unethical to waste valuable natural resources to produce products that will be used for only a
short time. The cost of designing and developing products, the value of training employees to sell those
products, and the way that customers decide to use the products are not reasons why the planned
obsolescence of certain products often is considered an ethical issue.

Group members most often generate new ideas by altering or building upon another idea. When more
than one person is involved in the creative-thinking process, different types of ideas are often generated
because each member has a unique point of view. Often, one member contributes an idea. When this
occurs, another member might come up with another idea based on the original idea. The success of
group creative-thinking processes depends on many factors, including each member's contribution and
the situation requiring idea generation. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that one technique is more

Redesign of packaging. When problems with products occur, businesses may be required by federal

rules. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires product labels which identify the product, provide the
name and address of the producer or distributor, and describe the contents of the package. Rather than
asking consumers for money when a product fails to meet government standards, a business is much
more likely to refund the consumers' monies or provide free repairs. A business would not care to pay
advertising expenses to make people aware of its product's problems. Problems with products appear in
news articles. In addition, the Consumer Product Safety Commission distributes information to the public

Points of difference. Positioning refers to the ways in which a business creates a certain image or
impression of itself in the minds of customers. A company evaluates many factors when it positions
itselfits target market, its products, and its competitors. By evaluating its competitors, the company can
determine ways in which it differs from other companies that provide similar products. By doing so, the
business is determining its points of difference with other businesses. By knowing these points of
difference, which include the competitors' strengths and weaknesses as well as its own, the business can
determine how to set itself apart from the competition. Then, the business can use this information to
position itself by emphasizing its uniqueness in comparison to its competitors. Profit margins, managerial
styles, and support services might be points of difference.

Organic marketing. Word-of-mouth promotion occurs when customers tell others about their satisfaction
with the business. Organic word-of-mouth promotion occurs naturally. Because customers are satisfied

normal conversation. In some situations, customers trust and like the product so much that they become
product advocatesputting in a good word whenever and wherever they can. Virtual marketing involves
communicating product information via the Internet. Mobile marketing involves communicating
information via mobile devices and networks (e.g., smartphones). Shill marketing involves employing
people to pose as customers who are satisfied with a business's product using word-of-mouth

Using interactive displays that allow attendees to try the tablet. Participating in a trade show is a way for
a business to communicate with the individuals or businesses most likely to buy the business's products.
Because there are many other exhibitors, a business needs to design a visually attractive space, offer
sales promotions, and display products in an appealing way to encourage attendees to stop at its booth.
When a business's salesperson demonstrates the product, trade-show attendees see the product's
attributes and how it works. In some demonstrations, the show attendees have an opportunity to try the
product (e.g., tablet computer) themselves. The event's staff members are responsible for handing out
the trade-show programs at the facility's entrance. A sign and name badges that depict a photo of the
product are not the most effective ways of drawing attention to a trade-show booth.

the goods and services, explain any warranties or guarantees, and list the price and availability. This
information can be used by salespeople in selling the goods or services to customers. Professional
publications, trade magazines, and product labels may be sources of selling information, but they are not
types of company promotional materials.

Answer remaining objections. Reaching closure is the fourth phase of the selling process. It often
involves answering any remaining objections the customer may have. Salespeople should anticipate
objections and learn to use them to their advantage in a sales presentation. When customers are
satisfied that their objections have been satisfactorily addressed, they often give off signals that the time
has come to close the sale. Salespeople sell product benefits when prescribing solutions to customer
needs. Salespeople do not determine buying needs or identify customer reactions during the reaching
closure phase of the selling process.

Physiological. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory suggests that motivation is related to five levels of
needs. Maslow's theory states that basic needs must first be met before a person is motivated to fulfill the
next level of needs. The most basic level of needs is physiological, which includes needs such as food,
shelter, and air. Therefore, Maslow's theory suggests that a person will purchase food to satisfy a
physiological need before s/he will be motivated to purchase a product in another level of needs. The rest
of the needs in sequential order are safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization.
