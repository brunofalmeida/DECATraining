purchased stock. Sole proprietorships are owned by one person who receives all the profits. Partnerships

Regulation policies are always being instituted, revised, and repealed. For example, the deregulation of
the airline industry resulted in lower airfares and more commercial airline routes. There are many
regulations in place to protect our physical environment; cruise ships have regulations as to how garbage
and waste can be disposed. Automobiles, buses, airplanes, and other forms of transportation are limited
to the types of fuel that can be used. Transportation is not the only industry that is regulated by
governments. Restaurants, lodging facilities, and tourist attractions all have regulations pertinent to the
specific industry. Because each segment of the travel and tourism industry provides different services,
regulations vary among businesses. For example, an amusement park has different safety regulations
than airlines.

 5. C
Authority to demand cooperation. Strong leaders have the authority and power to influence others and
direct the actions of others. A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to avoid
conflict within the channel because the leader has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and
demand cooperation, which reduces the possibility of conflict. The leader's authority makes it possible for
the leader to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member and persuade members to
accomplish their individual tasks. When each member is cooperating and working for the good of the
channel, there is less chance of conflict. It is not necessary for the leader to develop friendships. Channel
leaders usually do not provide training. It is not possible to regulate change, although an effective leader
will help channel members adjust to change.

complicated sentences are more difficult for people to read and understand. A sentence of between 17

Make eye contact. Looking customers in the eye is one way of demonstrating a customer-service
mindset. It shows that employees are focused on customers and their needs. Failing to make eye contact
indicates indifference and could cause customers to believe employees don't care about them or their
needs. Other ways of demonstrating a customer-service mindset include varying the tone of voice, rather
than speaking in a monotone, and smiling at customers, rather than keeping a straight face. It is
important to maintain good posture, although that doesn't mean employees should stand at attention.

Listen to the customer. The customer should be allowed to explain the entire complaint before anything
else is done. In some cases, it is helpful to restate the complaint to ensure understanding. The customer
may ask for a specific resolution to the problem, or the employee might ask the customer what s/he
would like to have done. Determining the appropriate action to take cannot be done until the complaint
has been clarified.

Make decisions. Authority is the power to influence or control the opinions or behaviors of others. An
employee's level of authority in a business is affected by his/her job responsibilities, and the guidelines
that allow him/her to make decisions on behalf of the business owners. For example, a factory line
worker does not have the same level or amount of authority to make decisions as the marketing
manager, who often makes decisions about staffing, budgeting, and other marketing activities. The
factory line worker usually has a certain way of performing specific tasks and does not manage others.
Therefore, the factory line worker has less power to make business decisions. Employees should strive
to solve problems rather than create them. Formulating ideas and applying knowledge are desirable and
important activities for all employees.

how much of each dollar of disposable income a consumer will spend instead of saving. The production
possibilities curve is a representation of production possibilities in an economy, given the efficient use of
limited resources. Nondurable goods and services include those items which are eventually used up—

Guest registration records. Secondary information is information collected by others. Guest-registration
records are internal sources of secondary information that are collected for one reason and may be used
for other purposes, such as for marketing. Guest registration records can provide information about
guests' preferences. By knowing this type information, the resort can customize promotional information
for guests. External secondary information is obtained from sources outside the hotel chain, such as
competitors' web sites, government documents (e.g., census reports), or online industry reports. Airline
passenger lists are external sources of information, which are often confidential. Room-status reports are
internal reports that advise hotel personnel which rooms are occupied and which rooms are not occupied.

demographic characteristics of typical visitors to the number of cars that drive the toll roads during

clients. It may also help convention planners to determine the optimal site for a trade show or business

Lodging occupancy rates will increase. Hospitality and tourism businesses monitor trends. Trends
provide hospitality and tourism businesses with information about changes that are occurring in the
industry. By knowing about industry changes, hospitality and tourism businesses can adapt so they can
effectively compete in the marketplace. Because hospitality and tourism businesses are often
interdependent, they will watch trends for various types of businesses within the industry. For example, if
more people are booking airline flights to popular destinations, then they will need lodging, which
increases the lodging occupancy rates. If more people need lodging, the hotels need to ensure that they
have the resources to accommodate the higher number of guests. If more people are traveling, it is likely
that they will spend more money at restaurants and that more people will attend or visit area tour
attractions. If tourism increases, then the area's unemployment rate will likely decrease because more
businesses will be hiring employees to meet the higher demand for hospitality and tourism products.

It is less expensive than conducting face-to-face interviews. Telephone interviews are less expensive and

of participants. Although it is a widely used method to collect information, there are several
disadvantages to using telephone interviews. For example, many people do not like being called for
marketing-research purposes, so they hang up on the interviewer, or they place their telephone number
on a national “do not call” list, which prohibits certain types of organizations from calling people on the
list. Telephone interviews do not necessarily provide more credible data than other survey methods.

Properly labeled. To make the data more interesting and easier to understand, businesses often present
data in a table. The graphic presentation of data supports and reinforces the oral or written information. It
is important that the data in the table be labeled so the audience understands what the data represent.
To provide clarification for the audience, labeling involves placing headings at the tops of the
corresponding columns or at the sides of the corresponding rows of the table. Although tables can
present data in a visually attractive way, the data will be meaningless without proper labeling. Tables
should be placed in the most appropriate or applicable section of a written report, which might include the
appendices. Large tables usually are not placed in the margins of a written report because of space
limitations.

Convention groups. Conventions consist of groups of people with a common bond (e.g., career or work)
that meet in one facility. Many convention activities involve trade shows or vendor exhibitions, seminars,
workshops, and general meeting sessions. Convention groups vary in size but can consist of more than
600 participants. Hotels that host convention groups must have enough sleeping rooms, meeting rooms,
and eating facilities to accommodate large groups. Sightseers and vacationers are considered leisure
travelers. These individuals often travel individually or in small groups (e.g., families). Business travelers
are those who frequent lodging facilities for business meeting purposes. Often, the meetings are held off
the hotel grounds. Business travelers tend to stay in lodging facilities for short periods of time, and many
travel alone or in very small groups. Long-term guests are those individuals who often reside for several
weeks or months in lodging facilities. Long-term guests are generally individuals or very small groups of
people. Leisure and business travelers and long-term guests are markets that tend to travel individually
or in small groups. Therefore, these markets do not generally need meeting rooms or large banquet
facilities.

from an employee's performance review will not help the business determine how to price its products.

is not an example of a technological problem or an environmental concern. Terrorism is not a medical
emergency in itself, although it may create medical emergencies due to a strain on local hospitals to treat
injured people.

Wearing disposable gloves when handling the items. Employees can protect their hands from bacteriaridden
waste or dangerous cleaning chemicals by wearing disposable gloves. For example, direct contact
with strong or dangerous chemicals (e.g., cleaners) might irritate skin or cause an allergic reaction. To
reduce contamination, it is preferable to store recyclables outside the premises. Waste or trash is usually
not sanitized. To reduce the risk of contamination, employees should wash their hands after handling
trash.

Know emergency escape and route procedures. Every hotel employee should know and understand
escape and route procedures in the event of a fire. A fire can occur anywhere, so each employee should
be familiar with escape routes and alternate escape routes in all areas of the hotel. Understanding and
following the procedures, if possible, helps to lessen chaos and increases the chance to get everyone out
of harm's way in a safe manner. Most emergency plans specify certain employees to conduct certain
activities during the evacuation. For example, one group of employees might make sure guests are
alerted to evacuate. Others might need to follow procedures to protect hotel documents such as guest
folios. During a fire emergency, a hotel's sprinkler system should activate automatically. If the sprinkler
system malfunctions, all employees should know how to activate the system. However, it is not
necessary for all employees to activate the system during the actual fire. Generally, the person closest to
the system would activate any backup system on the property. Fire extinguishers are not checked for
malfunctions during a fire emergency. They are evaluated by qualified inspectors during nonemergency
times. Hotels are often required to keep smoke detectors throughout the facility, including in each
sleeping and meeting room. Therefore, employees do not usually carry portable smoke detectors.

Plan ahead and work at a relaxed pace. Truly productive workers plan ahead so that they can work at a

that is not related to their level of productivity.

Leadership ability. Leadership is the ability to guide or direct the actions of others in a desired manner.
Employees who exhibit leadership ability are often considered for promotion when businesses have

considering employees' family status, ethnic background, or personal life when determining who to
promote.

Obtain further education and certification. Trade or professional organizations consist of individuals or
groups that work within a particular industry. Benefits of belonging to a professional organization include
networking opportunities, the establishment of consistent industry standards, trade shows, and venues
for members to further their education (e.g., seminars, workshops, classes, certification) within the
industry. Continuing education programs can help people keep up with trends associated with their
industry. The availability of government funding is dependent on each government's resources and
guidelines. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that all governments provide financial support to trade
organizations. Joining a professional organization does not necessarily improve or increase employee
productivity. Joining a trade organization might help industry members learn about the use of promotion,
but it does not necessarily develop the materials or programs for them.

Transports people to destinations away from home. Travel and tourism is a vast industry that provides
services to millions of travelers each year. A characteristic of the industry is that it transports people to
destinations away from home. This might range from a day trip on a motorcoach to a 14-day Caribbean
cruise. The common factor is that people leave their homes and travel by some form of transportation to
other destinations for a period of time. Depending on the length of the trip, overnight accommodations
and meals might be included. However, providing accommodations is a characteristic of the hospitality
industry. Meals might be arranged for all travelers, not just international travelers. The travel and tourism
industry does not organize activities in a local community.

Modifying existing products. Developing new products often is an ongoing process that involves
modifying existing products in some way. Modifications might include making a product more powerful,
changing the color of a product, or creating a slighter different version of a product. For example, a
company that adds frosting to a basic cereal is developing a new product by modifying an existing
product. Marketing specialty products, manufacturing convenience goods, and merchandising retail
goods are not examples of developing new products.

To appeal to the target market. Core values represent the underlying worth of products and the image
those products project. Products have value beyond price, and these values often are more important to
customers than the price. For example, the core values of one product might include quality construction
and a respected reputation. These are the values that appeal to the target market and encourage the
target market to buy the products. A business does not communicate the core values of its products to
justify the price, develop appropriate advertising, or analyze market research.

Determine customer preferences. One of the most important internal sources of information to use in
deciding what goods to buy is the business's past sales records. These records contain a wealth of
information, including statistics on customer preferences. Past sales records indicate how well certain
goods sold and if discounts were needed in order to move them. Businesses use this information to help
them decide what goods to buy in the future. Reviewing past sales records does not help a business to
select qualified vendors, analyze transportation schedules, or organize storage facilities.

Perishability. Many food items are perishable and must be ordered in smaller quantities and on a more
frequent basis. For example, fresh produce and bakery goods spoil more quickly than other types of food
items, such as canned and frozen goods. Restaurants consider the perishability of food items when
deciding when to buy. As a result, restaurants usually buy perishable items several times a week to make
sure the quality is acceptable. Dependability is a factor that restaurants consider when selecting a
vendor. Restaurants do not consider nutrition and sanitation when deciding when to buy food items.

The hospitality product is a good or service that satisfies a particular want or experience. Products refer
to the goods, services, or ideas that a business offers its customers. The hospitality industry consists of
businesses that provide products related to prepared food and beverage and traveling accommodations
for people. The hospitality product can include a tangible good (e.g., meal), service (e.g., dining
atmosphere), or a combination of both to create a specific feel or experience. Dining service and events
(e.g., concerts) are intangible rather than tangible products. Although hotel service is an important
product in the hospitality industry, it also encompasses other types of products, such as food and
beverage preparation. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that hotel service is the most important product in
the hospitality industry. Since hospitality products can be tangible, intangible, or a combination of both, it
cannot be assumed that more hospitality products are consumed rather than observed.

Selling a cruise and a city tour before departure. A product extension is an additional product related to,
but different than, the main travel product. Travel agents often provide these products as a service to
customers. For example, the main product in this situation is the cruise. If customers want to take a tour
of the port city before the cruise departs, a travel agent might arrange the tour as a product extension.
The product extension adds value to the original product and meets the needs of customers. In the other
examples, the travel agent is providing only the main travel product.

Advertising. Online advertising is a paid form of nonpersonal presentation of ideas, goods, or services
that appears on a web page. Internet advertising has many forms, including banner and button ads and
sponsorships. Sponsors are businesses or organizations that pay to associate their names or products
with another company or organization. Web hosting refers to the Internet service provider that keeps a
business's web pages up and running for a fee. Selling is a marketing function that involves determining
client needs and wants and responding through planned, personalized communication that influences
purchase decisions and enhances future business opportunities. Bonding is not a widely used term in the
Internet marketing industry to describe sponsorships.

Cost effective. The average cost of an e-mail campaign is around $1,000, whereas the average cost of a
direct-mail campaign is $20,000. The difference in price exists because the printed materials needed for
a direct-mail campaign are very expensive to produce. With e-mail, individuals can be pointed to a web
site where the same product descriptions, images, and other information can be found. Th ere is no need
to print materials or buy postage. Businesses often personalize e-mail messages and always identify
themselves because they are trying to sell products. E-mail marketing is not necessarily profit oriented,
although earning a profit is often the goal of businesses that use this technique.

To attract attention. Color in advertisements is an attention-getting device because readers tend to notice
color ads more often than black-and-white ads. Color is one of the most versatile elements of an
advertisement because it can attract attention and highlight certain parts of the ad. Also, readers are
more attracted to products that are depicted in their actual color. Unity, balance, and harmony are design
principles that do not necessarily involve the use of color.

Focal point. Effective advertising layouts usually contain a focal point that attracts attention and
encourages consumers to read the message. Focal points are often the illustrations, but they also can be

point often is an illustration, it is not necessarily a photograph. Not all ads contain a selling price or a Web
address.

Highlights specific element. Color is an important part of the composition of a print ad. The various colors

color is used to highlight a specific element of the ad such as the business's name which is associated
with a specific color. However, the other colors in the ad need to be in harmony with the highlight color.
For example, shades of brown and white go well with a highlight color of orange. Color harmonies in a
print ad do not create informal balance, develop logical sequence, or emphasize overall design.

Special event. Quick-serve restaurants often develop special events to attract customers and increase
sales. One type of special event might involve arranging a joint promotional campaign with an area
theme park. The restaurant sets up displays that promote the park, sponsors a contest that offers a grand
prize, and gives away free admission tickets to the park. Also, both the restaurant and the park advertise
the special campaign which encourages customers to visit the restaurant to have a chance of obtaining
free tickets or winning a grand prize. This special event generates increased traffic for the restaurant as
well as for the park. A publicity stunt is a one-time scheme intended to attract media attention rather than
a joint promotional campaign. A celebrity visit involves an appearance by a well-known star or athlete.
Trade shows are events where businesses display and/or demonstrate their products to build sales leads

maintain displays in order to utilize floor space, eliminate creativity, or evaluate performance.

persuade them to buy or remind them of positive experiences that will encourage them to buy again. The
travel and tourism industry often uses contests, sweepstakes, advertising campaigns, publicity, and
public relations as promotional tools.

Promotes immediate feedback and stimulates impulse purchases. Point-of-purchase merchandising
appeals to the emotions and visual senses. A window display may get a customer thinking about taking a
vacation, thus leading her/him into the agency and initiating immediate feedback. Often, customers who
haven't planned to book trips will decide to do so after seeing an agency's window display, thereby
making an impulse purchase. If customers have planned to book trips, they may change their minds—
booking trips that cost more than the original trip. Because a display can be used for several months, it
can lose impact and effectiveness over along period of time. Displays may stimulate interest in the
product, but customers will not purchase if the agent is not responsive or has no other information. Th us,
point-of-purchase merchandising usually requires the support of other promotional and/or sales tools.
Impulse buying does not generally increase long-term brand loyalty.

night's lodging, which is considered the main service. However, some hotels provide other services that
are included in the price of the room such as an exercise facility, swimming pool, shuttle service to the

the guest cancels within a certain period of time. Guests are not charged for requesting additional towels.

others are energetic. Considering the unique personality of each customer will help salespeople to be
successful. A person's environment and education might provide clues to her/his personality. Adaptability
is the ability to adjust to change, which is a characteristic that may be difficult for a salesperson to
identify.

order those dinners because they are priced lower than usual. If customers also have coupons for
discounts, the restaurant calculates the discount to determine the total cost. In this example, the
restaurant is offering lobster dinners for $22.99. A table of four orders the dinners, but two of the
customers have coupons for discounts. To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount
amount from the cost of the two dinners. To determine the amount of discount, add the cost of the two
dinners and calculate the 15% discount ($22.99 x 2 = $45.98; $45.98 x 15% or .15 = $6.897 or $6.90).
Then, subtract the discount from the cost of the two dinners ($45.98 - $6.90 = $39.08). Add the
discounted price of the two dinners to the regular price of the other two dinners to calculate the total cost
for the table ($39.08 + $22.99 + $22.99 = $85.06).

Communicate clearly. Managers must be able to clearly communicate their ideas and what they expect if
they want employees to be productive. Managers cannot expect workers to accomplish the business's
goals if employees don't know what the goals are or the procedures they should follow to achieve the
goals. Managers ask questions, listen, and obtain feedback to determine if they are communicating
effectively and if employees understand.
