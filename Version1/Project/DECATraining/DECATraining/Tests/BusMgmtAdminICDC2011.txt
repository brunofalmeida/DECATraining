A company uses an athlete's photo without permission to imply the endorsement of the product. A tort is
a wrongful action that harms another person or business. The invasion of privacy is a type of tort. For
example, if a business uses a well-known athlete's image without his/her permission to imply that the
athlete uses or endorses the product, the business has committed a tort related to the athlete's right to
privacy. Misrepresenting facts is a tort related to fraud. A statement that harms an entity's reputation is a
defamation tort. There is not enough information provided to determine if a tort has occurred in relation to
the employee's injuries. For example, the employee may have knowingly operated the equipment
incorrectly. A tort may exist if the business neglected to maintain the equipment or did not train the
employee to use it correctly.

questions when asked. It shows interest in the topic. A straight face is difficult for a speaker to interpret. It

Are often seen by people other than the recipients. When writing e-mail messages to customers and
coworkers, the correspondence should address various business issues; therefore, writers should
develop the messages using a concise, friendly, and businesslike tone. If the writer uses language that is
very casual, personal, or questionable, there is a risk of offending the recipient or others to whom the
recipient forwards the message. Because many businesses have e-mail policies and can monitor the
contents of e-mail messages going into and out of their companies, e-mail writers should take care not to
send inappropriate messages. Business e-mail messages do not need to be entertaining or informal, nor
do they need to include graphics. Many businesspeople save important e-mail messages and flag them
for follow-up at a later time.

Extra day of vacation for riding a bike to work instead of driving. Biking reduces car pollution. When
others see the company's employees riding their bikes, it reinforces the company's image as
environmentally friendly. The company is encouraging this behavior by offering a reward. A bonus of
$500 for finishing a project early may be important to employees and effective in motivating them to work
efficiently, but it is not seen by others outside the organization so it doesn't reinforce the company's
image. In addition, finishing early is not an activity that is perceived as environmentally friendly. Although
recycling does reinforce the "green" image, there are two problems with this response. First, those
outside the company aren't likely to see employees recycling, so it won't boost the company's image.
Secondly, airplanes pollute the environment, so the award is not in keeping with the company's green
image. The luncheon may motivate employees to turn in reports in a timely manner, but nothing about
this incentive or reward reinforces the company's environmentally friendly image.

A person's income depends mainly on the income their parents made. In a private enterprise economy, a
person's skills are the main determinant of his/her income. Supply and demand determine the exchange
of goods. For example, the higher the number of people who want to purchase Super Bowl tickets, the
higher the price the NFL can charge for each ticket. Private enterprise is regulated by the government,
but it is not controlled by the government. Regulated means that companies must adhere to guidelines
and laws, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspecting meat packing plants to ensure that
products are safe for consumption. In private enterprise, businesses may use marketing to increase sales
and cause consumers to become aware of product and services.

The law of diminishing returns. The law of diminishing returns states that when increasing amounts of
one factor (clothing racks, in this case) are employed, holding all other factors constant, after some point,
the resulting increase in output (sales, in this case) becomes smaller and smaller. In this scenario, this
may be because more racks make the store crowded, and consumers had trouble viewing the
merchandise. While the store has competitors, its decision to add racks of merchandise does not take
competitors into consideration. While the store likely is operating in a private enterprise system, the
declining sales increase caused by another clothing rack is not explained by that concept. Private
enterprise simply means a business unit is established, owned, and operated by private individuals for
profit. Economies of scale is the reduction in cost per unit resulting from increased production, realized
through operational efficiencies. This scenario does not deal with the cost of the clothing.

the crime rate is a social cost, not a fiscal cost. Income taxes will decrease during high unemployment
because fewer people have incomes that can be taxed. Sales tax collections will decrease because
people have less money to spend on goods that are taxed. Higher unemployment means more people

Insider trading. Insider trading involves leaking information to others that is not known to the public.
Insider trading laws vary by country, but violators could face imprisonment. In Joseph's situation, he told
his sister about the company's bankruptcy before it was made public so she could try to sell her stock
before she lost money. Embezzlement involves theft of valuables that have been entrusted to another's
care. Money laundering involves legitimizing money that was obtained illegally. A bribe is an illegal
payment intended to secure business or products In return.

Yes. Tom's errors could be costly to the company. Depending on the type of activity Tom is performing
and how long he has been performing it incorrectly, his errors could be costly to the business. Tom could
be using too many materials to produce a good, or he could be performing a process in a way that takes
too much time. Zoe's motives are self-serving because she wants to appear more efficient and
competent than Tom. These motives may be driven by a desire to get a salary increase or promotion.
Although some people may consider Zoe's motives unethical, there is no evidence that she has violated
procedural laws. If Zoe was concerned about the impact of Tom's performance on the company, she
could tell Tom what he was doing wrong, or she could advise her manager that Tom was performing a
task incorrectly. There is not enough information about Tom's task to know if it directly affects the

Knowledge mapping. Knowledge mapping software provides the ability to capture a business's
information sources and information flow in a graphic format. Knowledge maps help businesses
determine if there are underused sources of knowledge, as well as areas in which there is a breakdown
or gap in knowledge sharing. An Intranet is a business's internal computer network. Knowledge
management software can capture information stored on a company's Intranet, which is one of many
sources of a company's knowledge. Production and accounting software are different types of software
used in specific functions of business. Businesses do not use these software programs to capture and
track an entire organization's tacit and explicit knowledge.

Employees' knowledge is limited to a specific part of the process. By limiting the amount of information
employees have about an entire process, there is less risk that the company's trade secret will be
revealed. For example, to protect Kentucky Fried Chicken's secret breading recipe (11 herbs and spices),
the company mixes small increments of the breading in different locations. Then, the company collects
and mixes the smaller increments to create the famous recipe. By fragmenting the mixing process, no
single employee knows all of the ingredients. Fragmentation of processes does not replace the need to
copyright written or artistic works, eliminate the need for non-compete agreements, or reduce the need to
monitor all aspects of the production process.

Critical incident interview. Companies collect knowledge for a variety of reasons. When workplace
accidents occur, companies want to know how and why they happened, so they can take steps to
prevent similar accidents in the future. Questioning employees who witnessed the accident is a good
starting point for determining the cause of the accident. This questioning process is called a critical
incident interview. The knowledge gathered from the interviews helps the company understand the
circumstances or problems that led up to the accident. Brainstorming is a creative thinking technique. An

How do we obtain information about our customers in ways that do not violate their privacy? Businesses
can track their customers' purchasing habits in many ways—from Internet surfing activities to point of
sale data. Businesses must carefully weigh how to obtain, store, release, and use this information to
protect their customers' right to privacy. Society values this right, and if it is breached (e.g., selling
customer lists to third parties without customer authorization), customers may go to competitors to
purchase goods and services. When developing credit policies, businesses establish criteria and must
identify the information they need to determine their customers' ability to pay. Research methods used in

Communicate priorities. Employees carry out the work to achieve the organization's goals. To carry out
the work, managers must communicate their work priorities to employees. When employees know and
understand their priorities, they can perform the most important tasks before they tackle the less
important tasks. An organization's mission statement guides the goal-setting process, but it does not
provide specific information for completing specific work tasks. Although a variety of work subcultures
(e.g., departmental, team, social) exist in most organizations, managers must communicate their work
priorities to employees so that they can carry out tasks that will achieve organizational goals. Collected
information must be communicated and acted upon to achieve the organization's goals.

It serves as authorization to start the project. The project charter is a document that outlines the purpose
and terms of the project. It serves as a contract with the project's stakeholders. When all stakeholders
agree and sign the project charter, it serves as authorization for the project team to begin the project.
Actual outcomes cannot be assessed until the project is completed. The work breakdown structure
divides the project into work packages and tasks. Often, detailed task information is described in the work
breakdown structure dictionary. The project charter may be slightly modified, but any modifications must
be approved and signed off on by all stakeholders. Usually, any modifications to the project charter are
made by the project manager.

Scope statement. The statement of work (SOW) is a document that outlines the terms, commitments,
and conditions of the project. The scope statement is a component of the SOW that clearly defines the
things that the project team will do, as well as the things it won't do. The purpose statement defines the
purpose of or reason for carrying out the project. The communication plan provides details about the
types of reports and other forms of communication that the project team will provide stakeholders. The
goals and objectives section of the SOW outlines the desired outcomes of the project.

Work breakdown structure dictionary. Preparing the work breakdown structure (WBS) is the process of
dividing project tasks into meaningful components to complete the project. The WBS helps the project
manager identify tasks and effectively schedule, assign, and monitor complex project activities. The work
breakdown structure dictionary is a comprehensive "manual" that outlines project standards, activity
procedures, processes, and terminology. Team members can refer to the WBS dictionary if they need to
obtain information about how to carry out a task or activity. Project objectives are provided to
stakeholders in the statement of work (SOW) document, which may also include information about the
costs associated with the project. A network diagram is a graphic representation (e.g., map, chart) of the
project's schedule. A production schedule provides general deadlines for various activities and tasks.

Motivating the team. Project managers can motivate team members by reinforcing positive behavior and
by rewarding them for reaching certain goals. Offering an incentive such as a celebration luncheon can
encourage team members to keep striving to achieve the team's goals. In this situation, the project
manager is not expressing empathy, measuring goals, or offering a financial incentive, such as a bonus.

To determine if the deliverables achieved project goals. After the stakeholders receive the project
deliverables, the project manager develops a post-implementation review. The post-implementation
review is a formal, detailed assessment of the completed project in relation to the project's objectives.
The document assesses the project's budgets, deadlines, processes, and the stakeholders' satisfaction
with the results or deliverables. The “lessons learned” document outlines the successes and problems
with the project. It includes suggestions for improvement for subsequent, similar projects. Although
releasing project resources and archiving project documentation are important aspects of closing a
project, these activities are not the primary purpose of the post-implementation review.

Developing processes to prevent product defects. Quality management is the coordination of resources
to ensure the degree of excellence of a process, good, or service. Quality assurance is an aspect of
quality management. It involves developing systems and processes to prevent defects as the products
are being created. Quality control involves identifying defects in goods and services after they have been
created, which includes inspecting the finished product. Quality improvement is an aspect of quality
management that focuses on product improvement, which may involve using better materials to create
better products. Customer-satisfaction feedback can help businesses determine if they need to improve
their products.

Discipline and measurement. Six Sigma is a quality-management framework that focuses on
continuously setting higher goals of perfection to improve the quality of the business's goods, services, or
processes. Six Sigma uses quantitative information (easily measureable facts and data) to assess the
degree of improvement at various intervals and to continuously set new improvement goals. Because the
goals are measureable, the business must be disciplined in carrying out the activities to achieve the
established goals at each interval. Comparing the goals with the results holds the business accountable
for its actions. Although creativity, innovation, and customization may be important aspects of developing
quality products for some businesses, these aspects are not the focus of the Six Sigma framework.

Monitoring data. Continuous improvement is an ongoing process that looks for ways to increase the
levels of excellence in relation to a process, good, or service. By monitoring various data, the business
can detect problems, which can help the business identify ways or opportunities for improvement. After
the business identifies opportunities for improvement, it can set goals to improve quality. The
improvement goals may or may not include budget and resource issues.

Check. The first step in the PDCA continuous improvement technique is planning a change. During the
second step of the process, the business implements (does) the small-scale change. The third step
involves checking the results to determine if the small-scale change was effective. If the change was
successful, then the business takes action to implement the change on a larger scale.

Ethics committee. A breach of ethics poses a serious risk to businesses and may result in lawsuits, fines,
and other financial losses. Some companies have implemented ethics committees to monitor and guide
ethical policies and address ethical issues in the workplace. Committee members are often employees
from various departments or divisions at all levels of the organization. Ethics committees help ensure that
all employees, management, and board members are following ethical standards and regulations.
Human-resources council, retribution board, and executive commission are not groups or systems that

What-if planning. Companies often use computer software programs to analyze their levels of risk in
different business functions. The software calculates a company's risk levels in a variety of scenarios
based on different types of data queries. By establishing queries using different combinations of data, the
company obtains results under many circumstances. The company analyzes the quantitative results of
each scenario and uses them to make business decisions. This process is “what-if” planning. Qualitative
research is a study based on opinion or expertise. Top-down forecasting is a method of predicting sales.
During the product-development process, businesses conduct product feasibility studies to determine the
advantages and disadvantages of producing a certain good or service.

Captive insurer. When businesses cannot obtain commercial insurance to cover a risk, they may legally
form insurance companies as subsidiaries or sister companies to cover the losses associated with the
risk. These insurance companies are called captive insurers because they exist only to serve a specific
purpose—they are held "captive" by their parent companies. Lending institutions loan money to
individuals and businesses. Generic provider and organic entity are not types of insurance providers.

Obstruction of justice. Obstruction of justice is a legal penalty that applies to individuals or businesses
that hide important information from law enforcement agencies, such as concealing a client's
questionable financial data. If evidence indicates that unethical or illegal business practices have
obstructed a criminal investigation, the business could be fined, and the employees concealing the
information could face imprisonment. A public scandal could severely tarnish a business's reputation, as
in the case of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm and its affiliation with Enron. Expropriation is the act of
government taking over private property. Breach of contract involves breaking the terms of a legal
agreement. Substantiate means to provide proof or evidence of something.

Concurrent. Control is the management function of monitoring the work effort. Managers monitor the
work effort in many ways. Concurrent control involves monitoring the work while the employee performs
it. This allows the manager to determine if the employee is performing the work correctly and efficiently. If
the employee is not performing the work properly, the manager can provide the employee with corrective
feedback, which is a remedial action. Preventive control occurs before a business activity is performed.
Preventive control often involves establishing standards and procedures for carrying out the activity. An
external control strategy is based on a management philosophy in which employees are motivated
primarily by external rewards (e. g., bonuses, and awards).

Control. Control is establishing performance standards based on the company's objectives and then
evaluating and reporting the actual job performance. The scorecard allows top management to evaluate
job performance in each country. Planning requires administration to assess where the company is
currently and where it should be in the future. From there an appropriate course of action is determined
and implemented to attain the company's goals and objectives. While the scorecard may be evaluated
prior to planning, it is not a plan for moving forward. It is a picture of the current quarter. In the directing
function, management assists staff in meeting company as well as personal career goals. Organizing
involves creating an organizational chart, establishing and maintaining relationships, and assigning
required resources.
