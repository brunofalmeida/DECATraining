Trouble spots. The information in a profit-and-loss statement is cumulative, which means that it covers a specific period of time, usually one year. A business needs to be able to see cumulative totals of income and expenses in order to know where it is having successes and where there might be trouble brewing. If a company detects that it is spending too much on expenses compared to the amount of net profit, it knows that the category of operating expenses is a trouble area that must be corrected. Businesses do not use profit-and-loss statements to identify potential sales or problem vendors. Most businesses probably do not think that income can ever be excessive.

To calculate the amount to budget, add the total anticipated costs ($15,000 + $2,225 + $350 = $17,575). The number of coupons that will be redeemed affects the amount the business will budget for income rather than the amount it will budget to produce and distribute coupons.

Sole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship is owned and operated by one individual. Although Joan obtained a loan, she is still the sole owner/operator. A partnership is owned and operated by two or more persons. A limited partnership exists when some (but not all) partners have limited legal liability for the business. A corporation is a form of business ownership in which the business is owned by stockholders who have purchased shares of stock.

Health. Health insurance pays for different kinds of medical care, depending upon the type of policy. A basic policy might cover minimum medical expenses, while a policy that has major medical coverage might cover the entire bill. Disability insurance provides income for ill or injured workers while they are off the job. Homeowner's insurance protects the homeowner's personal property and home. Liability insurance protects against lawsuits that result from injuries to others.

Portraits. Each denomination of currency contains the portrait of a famous American patriot, many of whom were presidents. For example, one-dollar bills have the portrait of George Washington, and five-dollar bills have the portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Cashiers should be familiar with the portraits on each bill in order to detect counterfeits. If they notice that the portraits do not match the denominations, they will know that the bills are counterfeit. Currency contains a variety of numbers, and cashiers would not be able to know the ones on each bill. The dates vary depending on when the currency was printed. Addresses do not appear on currency.

Reduce the risk of fraud. Financial services employees need to be very diligent in checking things like signatures and picture IDs to protect their employer and their customers from fraud. It is important for employees to adopt a discipline; that is, a routine for making certain that a check casher or credit cardholder, for instance, really is who he or she says. Checking signatures and IDs do not determine whether customers are wealthy, and financial services employees should not treat any customer differently than another, whether they believe they are wealthy or not. Financial services employees should not be updating the bank's financial records without the supervisor's knowledge. Someone might be trying to get a signature on file fraudulently, for example. An employee should not make customers feel uncomfortable when checking their signature or ID. If you do suspect fraudulent activity, however, the best approach is to get your manager.

Putting away valuables quickly. Banks develop procedures for employees to follow in the event of emergency situations. Some situations, such as fire or bomb threats, involve evacuating the bank. In those cases, employees should know the plan for quickly putting away valuables such as cash, negotiable instruments, and important documents. For most banks, the plan is to quickly put these items in the vault, which is fireproof, and then lock the vault. Having a specific plan will enable employees to safeguard valuables and evacuate quickly to protect themselves. During emergency situations, employees are not expected to notify the news media, arrange transportation, or gather important evidence.

Persons over the age of 40. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission administers the Age Discrimination in Employment Act which is designed to protect older persons in the workplace. The act gives persons over the age of 40 some protection from certain arbitrary discrimination such as being fired for no cause. For example, a business may not fire an older employee simply because of the person's age or because s/he is in a high pay category. Persons over the age of 40 receive some protection regardless of whether they earn minimum wage. Temporaries and freelancers are not protected because they work on an as-needed basis and are not considered regular employees.

$16.10. The sales tax varies from area to area; however, retailers are required to charge sales tax and record, report, and pay the tax on the merchandise they sell. In this example, the sales tax rate is 6.75%. To calculate the amount of tax the retailer must record and report, multiply that percentage by the amount of the purchase ($238.50 x 6.75% or .0675 = $16.098 rounded up to $16.10).

Offer to schedule a second call. In some situations, you will call an important customer at a time when the customer is busy or in a hurry and is unable to speak to you. Then, it is appropriate to offer to schedule a second call at a time that will be convenient for the customer. You should not try to continue the conversation or explain that the call will be short if the customer indicates that this is a bad time. It is your responsibility to return the call rather than ask the customer to call you.

Developing a rough draft. An important step in preparing a simple written report is developing a rough draft. After the research is complete, the next step is to put the information into a logical format that covers the major points of the report. A rough draft may be revised many times, but it is the beginning of the actual writing process. Visual aids generally are used to support oral presentations. Scheduling a meeting is not part of writing a report. Interviewing may occur as part of the research  process, but it is not a common step in writing simple reports.

$70.39. When preparing invoices, cable companies list the price of services and calculate the extensions which is the total cost of each quantity of item purchased. In this example, the customer viewed five movies at $4.29 each; therefore, the company needs to calculate the extension to determine the total cost. To calculate the extension, multiply the unit price by the quantity ($4.29 x 5 = $21.45). Then, add the extension to the cost of basic service and the cost for one premium channel to determine the total amount of the invoice ($21.45 + $39.95 + $8.99 = $70.39).

Collect taxes. When the United States was founded, government was not intended to have a hand in business. One of government's original roles was the authority to set and collect taxes on the products businesses sell. These funds would be used to help pay the expenses of government. As the country grew and business expanded, government's role in business had to grow. Now, government also is responsible for enforcing laws that affect business, protecting consumers from dishonest or deceptive business practices, and conserving valuable natural resources.

Division of labor. Specialization by task exists when jobs are so specialized that a worker does only one small part of the total job. This type of specialization is also known as division of labor, which involves dividing a large job or large workforce into smaller unit parts in order to accomplish the job faster and easier. Stage of production is a type of specialization that occurs when more than one stage is required to change a raw material into a finished product. Scope is the number of tasks involved in a job, and depth is the amount of control an employee has in a job. Trade or profession is the type of work a person performs in order to earn a living.

Consumers and businesses spend less. When inflation sets in and prices rise, consumers change their spending habits, which is disruptive to the economy. Depending on the degree of inflation, consumer spending can fall dramatically, especially on larger purchases such as homes. The housing industry has been hard-hit during inflationary periods. Businesses also adjust their spending habits, and when interest rates on business loans are high, for example, they may cut back on factory orders to reduce the cost of borrowing. A decline in orders often causes factory layoffs. Changes in spending habits cause ripple effects and can have a dramatic impact on the economy.

Similar business subcultures. The business subculture of each country has its own unique beliefs, values, and ways of conducting business. The business subcultures of some countries are very similar to those of other countries. For example, the United States and the United Kingdom have similar business subcultures, which means that the businesspeople in these countries understand each other and conduct business in similar ways. Because of this, they trade successfully with each other. Countries that have different business subcultures may not be able to trade as successfully with each other because their businesspeople have different ways of doing business and may not understand each other as well. Different countries have different language traits, religious institutions, and governmental systems which may make it difficult for them to trade with each other.

Brief employment history. Businesses examine a variety of factors when deciding whether to grant credit to potential customers. One of these factors is the length of time a person has been employed. Businesses might deny credit to individuals who have been in the workforce only a short time because they have not established a dependable employment record. Businesses do not know if these people will keep a steady job and have the income to repay the credit. A small savings account and a limited investment portfolio are not factors that businesses usually consider when making credit decisions. Businesses usually grant credit to potential customers who have regular monthly incomes.

The remainder is then spread evenly over the expected useful life of the machine (6 years). Thus, ABC's new canning machine is depreciated $12,000 each year; at the end of year 3, total accumulated depreciation is $36,000.

24.4%. To calculate rate of growth, use the formula (earnings for second year - earnings for first year) divided by earnings for first year. In this problem, year-to-year earnings are .363 for year 1 to year 2 ($75,000 - $55,000 = $20,000 ÷ $55,000 = .363). For year 2 to 3 the rate is .133 ($85,000 - $75,000 = $10,000 ÷ $75,000 = .133).  The ratio is .235  for year 3 to year 4 ($105,000 - $85,000 = $20,000 ÷ $85,000 = .235). Then, add the three ratios and divide by 3 to calculate the average rate of earnings (.363 + .133 + .235 = .731 ÷ 3 =  .244 or 24.4%).

Reduce uncertainty for investors. A stable dividend policy is one that regularly pays dividends to shareholders in order to reduce uncertainty by providing them with a steady income. A stable dividend policy is attractive to many investors, maximizing market price per share and increasing shareholders' expectations. Paying dividends only when other needs are met is a residual dividend policy.

Lending and owning. Debt financing occurs when a corporation raises capital by borrowing money (from a bank, for example) or by issuing bonds. In either case, someone is lending money to the corporation. Equity financing occurs when a corporation raises capital by selling stock, or shares of ownership. Investing and financing, capital and borrowing, and assets and liabilities do not accurately describe this activity.

The ways that people form/conduct relationships with one another. Relationships between people are often very complex and can be either effective or ineffective. Effective human relations are characterized by the ability of people to get along with one another. Public relations are activities sponsored by a business to create and/or foster a positive image. The number of people with whom you come in contact on a daily basis has nothing to do with how you get along with those people.

Productivity. Productivity is the amount and value of goods and services produced (outputs) from set amounts of resources (inputs). The overall output of all employees is often increased when businesses use teams because workers who feel they are an important part of a team often work harder and produce more. Other reasons that teams are important to businesses are that they reduce costs and workplace conflicts. Teams do not increase procrastination—putting off until tomorrow what should have been done today.

Customers' confidence in the business increases. Customers' confidence in a financial services business grows when the business provides accurate answers to their product questions. They feel the sales staff are knowledgeable, which also gives customers more confidence in the financial products they buy. Customers are less likely to need to return products when their questions about those products have been answered, and their total purchases are more likely to increase than decrease. Customers may need to ask fewer questions when their inquiries are handled in an effective manner.

Whether the business should pay men and women different salaries if it is operating in a country where equal pay laws don't apply. Ethical dilemmas occur when there is a question as to the legality as well as the morality of making a particular decision. Whether to donate money, where to hold a party, or whether to have employees pay for business cards are simply decisions that companies have to make that do not involve a moral judgment or legal issue. Choosing how to pay employees based on their gender represents both a moral and legal question and is, thus, an ethical dilemma.

Standard. The purpose of conducting exit interviews is to obtain information that a financial services business can use to make improvements and reduce employee turnover. One way to obtain useful information is to ask standard questions that all employees answer when they leave the business. It is often helpful for businesses to develop a standard exit interview form so human resource personnel always ask the same questions. Then, the standard information can be summarized and used to review the good and bad points that employees explain during the interview. Businesses usually do not ask personal or technical questions during an exit interview unless they pertain specifically to the business, such as reason for leaving or problems with equipment. Sometimes businesses probe for information if employees are reluctant to answer questions. However, asking standard questions often makes it easier for employees to answer honestly.

Role playing is an instructional method in which trainees are presented a situation and are given roles to play, but no script is involved.

Training. By regularly evaluating employees, financial businesses can determine if their employees need additional training. As financial businesses become more complex, employees may need to operate specialized equipment or handle new situations. Regularly conducting evaluation sessions will give both employees and the financial business the opportunity to discuss problems that may indicate a need for additional training. Orientation acquaints new employees with their surroundings and provides information about the company and its policies. Orientation occurs before employees are evaluated on their performance. Incentives are bonuses paid for excellent performance. Employees who receive outstanding evaluations may be awarded bonuses. Employee benefits include paid vacation, health insurance, retirement plans, etc., and are provided for all employees regardless of the results of evaluations.

Place expensive rush orders. Financial businesses should try to keep in stock the proper quantity of office supplies. Running out of office supplies may force the financial businesses to buy locally or place rush orders that often are expensive. Suppliers that handle rush orders usually charge financial businesses a premium price for quick delivery. Therefore, not keeping track of the quantity of office supplies may be costly to financial businesses. Financial businesses that run out of supplies are not ordinarily forced to go out of business, to stop selling merchandise, or to recruit additional personnel.

Verifying tellers' cash. Banks routinely conduct audits to verify financial information. One of the main functions of a routine audit is to verify that the tellers' cash drawers agree with the amount listed in the bank's records. Tellers should make sure that their cash is correct at all times because most audits are unannounced. Sealing cash drawers is part of an audit, but is not the main function. A routine bank audit is not intended to locate valuables or identify embezzlers, although embezzling might be detected during an audit.

Each agent sells 85% of quota. One of the purposes of developing a business plan that includes quarterly sales quotas is to provide the insurance agency with a tool for tracking its progress. An effective business plan includes a way to measure performance on a regular basis rather than waiting until the end of the year to find out if the goals have been met. Many plans contain quarterly sales quotas that can be compared to actual sales to determine if the insurance agency is on track or needs to make adjustments. If each insurance agent sells only 85% of the quarterly quota, the insurance agency will want to make changes to improve its performance. A business plan might set the same sales quotas for several consecutive quarters. Business plans usually take into consideration seasonal fluctuations in sales. Each insurance agent may have a specific territory, but that is not a way that insurance agencies track their progress.

Show that s/he has been learning about the company. The job applicant can read or ask questions about the company before the job interview so that s/he can ask intelligent questions during the interview. This makes a favorable impression because it indicates that the applicant has a sincere interest in the job and the company. Job applicants should sit upright during an interview, not slouch or lean back in the chair. Applicants make a good impression when they dress a little more formally than they would on the job. For example, a financial planner should not go to a job interview in jeans and a sweatshirt. Letting the interviewer know that the applicant expects to be hired indicates a cocky attitude that is likely to make a poor impression.

Financial goals. A financial plan is a road map, of sorts, that guides individuals from Point A to Point B, or from where they are to where they want to be financially. Financial plans begin with establishing clear and measurable objectives, such as having sufficient income to pay for college or retirement. Once goals are established, a financial plan then outlines steps for achieving those goals and measuring progress along the way. Significant wealth could possibly be one of the goals an individual wishes to accomplish, but it is not, in and of itself, the purpose of a financial plan. Financial plans are not designed to help individuals achieve a financial career. Financial plans are not intended to increase social status.

Other employees. An effective way for bank tellers to obtain financial product information is to ask other employees. If tellers are new on the job, they may have questions about certain products. Also, if banks offer new products, tellers may need additional information. Other employees within the bank are good sources of this type of information. For example, loan officers or branch managers generally are able to answer questions and provide updated information. Also, a new teller would be able to obtain product information from an experienced teller. Although satisfied customers often are very knowledgeable about the financial products they buy, tellers should not rely on them for specific information. A bank teller may have very little personal contact with a regional manager. College interns are learning the banking process and are not good sources of information.

Monthly payment. Installment loans are often complicated because they may include various additional charges and fees. Therefore, loan officers frequently use interest charts that list monthly finance charges as well as other charges to determine the amount of the monthly payment. The charts include a breakdown of payments based on number of months, such as 12 or 18, loan amounts, such as $1,000, and annual percentage rates, such as 7½ percent. A loan officer finds the line on the chart that corresponds to the customer's particular loan in order to determine the monthly payment. The principal is the amount the customer is borrowing. The annual rate or percentage is the interest charged on the loan.

"The high cost is because of the high quality." The boomerang, or toss-it-back, method is changing an objection into a reason for purchasing an item; therefore, an objection to the price of a high-priced item can be turned into a reason for buying by stressing the quality of the item. Saying that the product is not all that expensive is the denial method, which seeks to correct wrong information or the customer's misunderstanding. Asking whether the customer would be happy with a cheaper model is the inquiry method, which helps customers answer their own objections. Telling the customer yes, the product is expensive, but you asked for it is the yes, but . . . method, which acknowledges the objection without directly contradicting the customer.

Mutual funds. A mutual fund is an assortment of diversified stocks and bonds that may be purchased by individuals or businesses. Investors often buy mutual funds because they do not want to spend the time identifying and selecting specific stocks. In most cases, the stocks that make up the mutual fund have been carefully evaluated in order to provide the best possible return on investment. An investment company might recommend that a business invest retirement money in mutual funds because the funds are safe and will increase in value over the years.

Using an appropriate closing technique without hesitation. This allows the financial planner to display confidence in the client's investment product decision, as well as adapt a technique to close the sale that fits that client. Do not oversell by being too eager or pushy and by trying to sell the client something other than the investment product they need. Telling the customer that the investment product yields financial returns slowly might indicate that the product may not a good choice.

Recommending possible uses. Bank representatives who are familiar with their banking products know that the products can often be used in a variety of ways. Explaining to customers the many ways to use a home-equity loan will give them ideas and encourage them to proceed with the loan. For example, a home-equity loan can be used to make home improvements, purchase a car, or pay for college tuition. Promoting new products involves informing customers about other banking services, which may be unrelated to their immediate needs. Showing related products involves suggesting related products that can be used with the customer's original purchase, usually goods rather than banking services. Advising a customer to purchase large quantities involves suggesting that customers purchase larger amounts of a particular good rather than a banking service.

Politely explain bank policies. Not all banks are willing to complete auxiliary transactions, which might include accepting payment for utility bills or processing tax payments to local governments. If customers ask tellers to complete such transactions, the tellers should politely explain bank policies. In some cases, banks will complete auxiliary transactions only for an additional charge, which may be more than customers want to pay. Again, tellers should explain the bank's policy before proceeding in the event that customers do not want to pay the fee. Tellers do not refer customers to other banks. Offering to provide other services probably will not satisfy customers. Quickly dismissing the requests would be rude and might offend customers.

Any minimum balance requirements. Most banks offer several types of savings accounts, some of which require that customers maintain a minimum balance in order to avoid paying a service charge.

It is not necessary to explain additional services when opening new accounts although bank employees often do so to help customers with other financial needs. Bank employees should explain regulations in terms that customers will understand rather than in technical terms. Bank employees usually do not explain the location of security devices.

Financial plan. Financial professionals must thoroughly understand the customer's financial condition (situation) before developing a plan and recommendations for achieving financial objectives. Together, the customer and financial professional outline the customer's assets and liabilities to obtain a comprehensive view of the customer's net worth. They define objectives in terms of what the customer wants to achieve financially. The financial professional recommends various strategies related to saving, investing, debt reduction, or reducing tax liabilities, for example, as ways to achieve the objectives. Along with objectives, desired results are also defined in terms that can clearly be measured. A dividend reinvestment program is the option investors need in order to have any dividends paid by their investment holdings automatically put back or reinvested into their accounts. Customer communications programs are developed to provide information to large numbers of customers as opposed to individual ones. A home mortgage contract is a part of a financial institution's lending, or borrowing, procedures, which involve extensive credit scoring and adherence to federal guidelines.

Count the money several times. Processing cash is one of the main functions of a bank teller. To do the job correctly and avoid costly mistakes, it is important for a teller to count the money several times. When accepting cash for a deposit, a teller should count several times before putting the money in the drawer. If the teller is paying out money, it is effective to count once when taking the cash out of the drawer, a second time to verify the first count, and finally when handing the money to the customer. Organizing money into stacks is not effective unless the money is stacked according to denomination. Bank tellers usually do not check the dates on the money.

Cashing presigned checks. Traveler's checks are negotiable instruments that have cash value. When traveler's checks are issued, customers sign one signature line and leave blank the other signature line. The second signature line is signed when customers cash traveler's checks. Bank tellers should never cash presigned traveler's checks because they may be stolen. The purpose of having the customer re-sign the checks is to verify identity by comparing the countersignature to the original signature. Bank tellers may ask for identification when accepting traveler's checks. They should treat the checks the same as cash and compare the countersignature to the original.

Being accurate helps to avoid differences. Have a routine, and always count money in the same way. When paying out cash to customers, ask them how they want it. Count the coins first, then the bills, larger denominations first. Pay out the coins first, then the currency. Counting it out to the customer is simply one final check and also serves to reassure the customer, since s/he watches while you're counting. Counting money out to customers is not done because customers don't trust tellers; it is simply a safety check. Banking regulations do not require counting money out to customers; however, a financial institution's internal procedures probably do. There is no evidence that it is bad luck to count money only once.
