communities throughout the world. In an effort to control pollution, many countries have established
environmental regulations that require businesses to develop clean and fuel-efficient operating and
production systems. These systems protect the environment from industrial pollution and help to
preserve natural resources. Many of these regulations also require businesses to control the amount of
waste and dispose of it properly. Environmental regulations are intended to conserve resources. A

valid and useful to businesses. It is not important to identify sources that provide relevant, valid written
material to compile a database, understand business communication, or prepare a routine message.

Yes, because other participants' ideas can trigger new ideas. This process is called steppingstones or
triggers, and it is encouraged in brainstorming because one person's ideas can easily trigger new and
different ideas. It is not considered stealing, but instead is an important part of working together to build
on each others' ideas to find more ideas. Adding a steppingstone idea to a brainstorming list is not a form
of evaluating the original ideas. All ideas are considered equal in a brainstorming session, including those
that are very outlandish or outrageous.

Creates desire. A persuasive message is intended to change a person's mind or to convince someone to
take action. For the message to be effective, it should create a desire in the person to do what the
message wants. It should present a good reason or potential benefit that will persuade the reader.
Otherwise, there may be no incentive for the person to do what the message wants. Persuasive
messages often are assertive, but they should not be aggressive. Persuasive messages do not describe
a process or summarize an issue.

Company policies. Supervisors and employees need to communicate with each other on a regular basis
in order to function effectively. One type of information that supervisors often communicate to employees
in writing is information about company policies. Supervisors want to make sure that employees
understand company policies so that they will be able to work efficiently and accomplish company goals.
Providing this information in writing ensures that it is available to employees at all times. Personal
opinions and workplace rumors usually are communicated verbally. Supervisors usually do not
communicate community news to employees.

Image. Business image is the view or opinion that customers have about a business. Salespeople can
improve the image of the company in the eyes of its customers by knowing company policies and
procedures and being able to accurately interpret them to the clientele. Properly explaining policies will
help to avoid misunderstandings and to improve the company's image. A routine is a regular course of
action; goals are objectives to be met. Rules are regulations. A business establishes routines, goals, and
rules in order to avoid misunderstandings with customers and improve its image.

A lower rate of inflation. When a lot of people are out of work, they lose their buying power, which means
less money is in circulation. Because unemployed people have less disposable income, the demand for
goods and services is low, which tends to slow or lower the rate of inflation (rise in prices). The amount of
monetary policies that the Fed establishes does not affect unemployment rates. When the GDP grows,
an economic expansion is occurring, which indicates that people and businesses are spending money,
and the unemployment levels are low.

Both men and woman are expected to wear modest clothing in public. When businesspeople visit a
foreign country, they should try to learn about the culture so that they don't do something offensive.
Before going to a foreign country, businesspeople should research the country's standards for
appearance and dress. For example, wearing shorts or tank tops in Middle Eastern country is exhibiting
an inappropriate appearance. Middle Eastern businesspeople would not take foreigners seriously and
would be quite offended if they walked around in shorts and tank tops. Other aspects of the culture that
foreign businesspeople may want to research include nonverbal behavior such as facial expressions and
gestures and communication styles. Because government and religion are closely connected in many

Failing to accept responsibility for his actions. When you take responsibility for your actions, you accept
the consequences (good and bad) of your behavior, which is based on the decisions you make. Taking
responsibility for your actions often involves admitting and learning from your mistakes and trying to do
better in the future. In the example, Ned became defensive about a mistake that he made and blamed
another employee. By blaming another employee, Ned is failing to accept responsibility for his actions,

Paying credit-card balances on time. Credit allows a person to purchase now and pay later. Building a
good credit history involves using credit responsibly, which includes making credit-card payments on
time. It is important to build good credit because lending institutions look at a person's credit history to
determine if s/he should receive a loan. When an individual has a poor credit history, s/he may not be
able to obtain large loans to buy a car or house or to start a new business. Responsible credit involves
striving to maintain a high credit rating, looking for the lowest interest rates possible, and limiting the
number of credit cards they use. Although it is a good idea to seek counseling to reduce unmanageable
debt, this action is taken when a person has not used credit responsibly.

because of the Internet and the World Wide Web. E-commerce is changing the way companies do
business because it allows them to be accessible to customers at all times. Customers who have access
to a computer and the Internet can visit a business's web site and obtain information or shop online at
any time of the day or night. As a result, more and more businesses are adding web sites to make their
services and products available to customers at all times. The benefit to a business is often increased
sales. The growth of e-commerce is increasing competition, which means that businesses often reduce
prices and offer additional services to attract customers. Businesses do not use e-commerce to
communicate with similar organizations.

Expand into other markets. An environmental scan is a study of the external forces that influence a

adjustments and computer improvements are internal factors that a business considers when it wants to
enhance its productivity. A business should always follow government regulations.

Identify trends. Statistics are information presented in numerical form. Statistics can be used to identify
trends. Trends indicate the general direction in which people or events are moving. If numerical data
show that the demand for a product has been steadily increasing for several months, then the trend
indicates that more people want or need the product. By analyzing this information, the business can
determine if it wants to enter a new market. Or, if the business already sells the product, it can use the
information to decide if the business should increase its production of or inventory levels for the product.
Although statistics are used to analyze costs, inventory, and quotas, the information provided cannot be
used to assess those situations.

Zoning ordinances. Zoning ordinances are regulations that govern the ways in which land and buildings
may be used in certain jurisdictions. In many towns and cities, land is designated for commercial
(business) or residential use. Although zoning ordinances vary by community, they may regulate the size
of the facility. In many situations, cities require that some buildings be designed to accommodate a
certain style (e.g., American colonial). A company that wants to build a facility in a certain location must
consider the city's zoning ordinances to make sure that the regulations are compatible with the
company's needs and goals. Health regulations are laws that are designed to protect the health and wellbeing
of society. A partnership agreement is a written agreement (contract) signed by business partners
that specifies the terms of the partnership arrangement. The tax code outlines the tax obligations and

Thread, buttons, and zippers from Tara and denim from Bill. Work efforts are often interdependent—
workers rely on each other to accomplish a task or goal. In many situations, specific people are
responsible for providing specific elements to complete a project or achieve a goal. In the example,
Lauren needs several items from Bill and Tara so that she can perform her job of sewing the jeans.
Because Bill is the fabric buyer, he is responsible for buying the denim so Lauren can make the jeans.
Tara buys the small items needed to make the jeans, so she is responsible for obtaining items such as
thread, buttons, zippers, snaps, and pins. Corduroy is a different type of fabric used to make various

Easier to manage. It is easier to manage vendor relationships when a company works with a small group
of vendors. When the company works with fewer vendors, it has more time to cultivate long-term
relationships with each vendor. Long-term relationships benefit both the company and the vendor
because both businesses are willing to share information; are understanding of each other's needs,
expectations, and limitations; and are more willing to work together to resolve conflicts that might occur.
Working with a few vendors does not always provide the business with a wider product selection. A
disadvantage to working with a few vendors is that supply interruptions are more likely to affect the
company because it may not have easy access to another source that sells similar goods or services.

Business operations are smoother. Businesses that do not practice good maintenance are more likely to
experience emergency repairs, injuries, and less customer satisfaction. Maintenance costs are part of the
operating expenses of a business and are not deducted from taxes. The business saves money by

Incorporate the best overall quality-improvement processes. Capability Maturity Model Integration
(CMMI) software helps guide improvement for projects, for departments, or throughout the overall

compares the business's existing processes with the CMMI model to evaluate efficiency levels. The audit
results guide the business's decision making by examining both the efficient processes and inefficient
processes. By using the CMMI model, the business can integrate its successful processes with those
suggested by the CMMI model, which can help the business's quality improve. The purpose of the CMMI
quality management framework is to facilitate quality improvement rather than develop long-term financial

provider can be ended at any time. Customers will probably receive better service since the business is
not having down time when its computers malfunction. Speculative risk is the chance of loss or gain.
Pure risk exists when, if something happens, it will result in a loss.

Contract. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties stating that one party is to do
something in return for something provided by the other party. By putting the terms of an agreement or
business arrangement in a written contract that both parties sign, the business reduces the risk of
misunderstanding about what is expected and what will be provided. When agreements are not
documented and a problem occurs, legal action may be required, which can be costly to the business. An
invoice is a bill. A premium is a fee for an insurance policy. A warrant is a legal document issued by
authorities that requires an individual or business to take a certain action.

What do we want to do? The management function of deciding what will be done and how it will be
accomplished is planning. A primary aspect of the planning function is determining the goals or desired
outcomes—determining what we want to do. All activities carried out in the other functions of
management—organizing, staffing, controlling, and directing—depend on the answer(s) to the question,
"What do we want to do?" Deciding who will do the work is a staffing activity. Measuring the success or
achievement of goals is a controlling activity. Determining how to monitor the work effort is a directing
activity.

to operate the new computer system, she is focusing her efforts on the staffing function of management.
Controlling is the management function of monitoring the work effort. Training involves teaching or
developing a new skill. Planning is the management function of deciding what will be done and how it will

Motivating. Directing is the management function of providing guidance to workers and work projects.
Directing often involves motivating employees, which is getting employees to strive to achieve
management's objectives because they want to achieve them. Managers motivate employees in a variety
of ways, including providing positive feedback and encouragement as well as offering attractive
compensation packages (salary and benefits). Planning is the management function of deciding what will
be done and how it will be accomplished. Coordinating work tasks is an activity in the organizing function
of management, which involves setting up the way the business's work will be done.

Rework. Control is the management function that monitors the work effort. Because Pablo is initiating
corrective action to fix a problem or output, he is engaging in the rework control process. Preliminary
control is a form of control in which the manager takes action to prevent problems from occurring.
Developing a contingency plan or an alternative course of action is often part of preliminary control
process. Functional is not a term that describes a form of control. Control refers to the management
function that monitors the work effort.
