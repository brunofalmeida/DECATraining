Consistent treatment. Legal procedure refers to the methods and processes used to protect an
individual's or business's legal rights. These rights include the right to obtain legal counsel, the right to be
heard in court, the right to confront the accuser, etc. Legal procedure involves following the same steps
and protocol to ensure that both the defendant and the plaintiff are treated in a fair and consistent
manner. The purpose of legal procedure is not to ensure that each party receives ongoing advice. In
most legal proceedings, one party is not going to be satisfied with the verdict or outcome. An indictment
is a formal charge or accusation of a crime.

Corporation. Wal-Mart, Chevron Texaco, and Ford Motor Company are all large businesses owned by
their shareholders, who own stock in the company. These businesses are operated under written
permission from the states or provinces in which they operate. A sole proprietorship is a business owned
and operated by one person. A partnership is owned by two or more people. A franchisee purchases the
rights to operate a business using the parent company's (franchisor's) name.

Getting their products to consumers more efficiently. Channels of distribution benefit businesses by
getting their products to consumers more efficiently. This may help to raise profits, but it is not a
guarantee. Channels may lower the prices of some but not all industrial goods. Channels allow
businesses to share channel tasks, but they will not be able to avoid all channel tasks—every channel
member contributes.

4. C
Producer. The channel of distribution begins with the producer. The producer's goal is to reach the
consumer as quickly and efficiently as possible. A retailer buys consumer goods or services and sells
them to the ultimate consumer. A wholesaler buys goods from producers or agents and sells them to
retailers. An agent assists in the sale and/or promotion of goods and services, but does not take title to
them. The retailer, wholesaler, and agent are intermediaries because they operate between the producer
and consumer to help the movement of goods and services.

5. A
Introduce new items in the marketplace. A slotting fee is a cash premium that producers pay to
businesses to cover the costs associated with carrying a new product. In many cases, the producer that
offers the largest fee is the one that gets shelf space for its new product. This presents an unethical
situation because many small producers cannot afford to pay large slotting fees, which limits the
introduction of new items in the marketplace. Exclusive dealing is an illegal practice when it restricts
competition; however, it may be legal when small businesses are entering the marketplace. Direct
distribution is a channel of distribution in which products move directly from the producer to the end user.
Slotting fees may hinder a business's ability to distribute its products to the target market, but the slotting
fees do not limit the business's ability to identify potential target markets.

Vertical. Vertical conflict involves disagreements among businesses on different levels of the same
channel of distribution. Manufacturers and their authorized dealers are in the same channel of
distribution, but they are on different levels. Conflict might occur if the manufacturers develop policies or
restrictions that anger the dealers and which the dealers refuse to accept. Horizontal conflict occurs
among businesses at the same level in a channel of distribution. Indirect and corporate are not types of
channel conflict.

Credibility of the sources. When identifying sources that provide relevant, valid written material, the
researcher evaluates a variety of factors, including the credibility or believability of the source. If the writer
provides feasible supporting evidence to back up an opinion, outcome, or claim, the researcher may
determine that the source is credible. Other considerations are the timeliness of the data or article, the
relevance of the information to the topic at hand, and the expertise of the writer or publisher. Readability
of the text involves the reader's ability to understand the content. If the researcher is evaluating a
research study, s/he might analyze the margin of error of certain types of data as one factor in
determining a source's credibility.

Follow directions. In order to follow directions or instructions, the person receiving them must listen
carefully. Listening is an important skill for everyone, but it is especially important to workers who receive
directions from supervisors about their job duties. Good listeners are often effective workers who are less
likely to receive criticism and more likely to earn raises. However, listening skill does not enable workers
to avoid all criticism, to earn frequent raises, or to become good speakers themselves.

Actively. Active listening is giving full attention to what is being said. It enables the listener to note major
points and to notice gestures or actions which give added meaning to what is being said. Passive
listening is casual listening, or paying only partial attention to what is being said. Distractedly describes a
listener whose mind is on other things, not just on what the customer is saying. Listening to customers
should be thoughtful and rational, not emotional.

Frustrated. Nonverbal cues can tell others a lot about your emotions. In this situation, Ryan's nonverbal
behavior indicated that he was frustrated because he couldn't get his computer to do what he wanted it to
do. If Ryan was patient, he would not continuously hit his keyboard, turn red, or frown. If Ryan was bored,
he would be inattentive about his situation or surroundings. He might even yawn or do something other
than computer work for a while. Enthusiasm is associated with a positive attitude.

The use of toxic chemicals in the environment can result in the extinction of many species of waterfowl.
This example indicates that the extinction of waterfowl (the end result or effect) is caused by the use of
toxic chemicals (the cause). The public supports increased spending on national security, and a survey
reports that over seventy percent of the citizens fear future terrorist attacks: This is an example of the use
of a generalization with an example method of presentation organization. Monet and Cezanne were both
impressionist artists; however, their painting techniques and use of color varied greatly: This is an
example of the compare and contrast method of presentation organization. An example of the
enumeration method of presentation organization is as follows: We will begin by discussing the basic
steps used in developing effective time management techniques, and the first step is to prioritize all of
your commitments.

Use abbreviations and symbols. Developing a system of and writing down abbreviations and symbols
(i.e., shorthand) is much quicker than writing out long phrases and complete sentences. For example, to
remember a very important point, Allison might place a star or asterisk by a key word, short phrase, or
abbreviation. After the seminar, Allison can refer to her “shorthand” notes and write more comprehensive
notes for future use. Writing on note cards, focusing on subtopics, and asking the speaker to provide
handouts will not help Allison take accurate notes in real time.

Essential information. E-mail is a quick, efficient way to communicate with customers and coworkers. The
primary reason for writing the e-mail message is to inform others about various business activities;
therefore, it should be written in a friendly, professional manner that contains essential information.
Businesspeople tend to receive a lot of e-mail messages, so it is important to get to the point quickly. The
message should be concise, free of typographical errors, and grammatically correct. The e-mail message
may or may not be urgent, persuasive, or encouraging in nature—these factors depend on the purpose of

Routine. Employees often use simple written reports to provide managers with routine information, such
as the number of items sold each week. Routine information is the type of data that managers need on a
regular basis in order to monitor the operation of the business. Simple written reports are straightforward
and direct and contain only routine business information. They do not contain analytical, extensive, or indepth
information, which is usually presented in complex written reports.

Friendly. Positive customer/client relations are important to the success of the business because they
help to create repeat business. Many businesses encourage employees to adopt a friendly, helpful
attitude toward customers as part of their efforts to create positive relations. Being reserved could
prevent employees from offering appropriate help and might be interpreted as coldness. Being talkative
may offend customers or prevent employees from identifying their needs. Being authoritative is only
appropriate when providing the customer with technical or factual information.

in production. An economizer is someone who strives to obtain the greatest satisfaction from his/her
limited resources.

type of economic risk. Natural risks result from such natural causes as floods, tornadoes, fires, lightning,
blizzards, and earthquakes. Human risks are caused by human weakness and the unpredictability of
employees and/or customers. Incompetence is a form of human risk whereby the employee does not

Diminishing returns. The law of diminishing returns states that, at some point, adding more employees
does not proportionately increase productivity. Each business operates effectively with a certain number
of employees who are able to make the best use of the business's resources. After that point is reached,
hiring more employees causes an overabundance of employees in relation to the available resources.
The additional employees get in each others' way, which causes an overall decrease in each employee's
level of productivity. Negative returns is a stage of production in which businesses usually stop hiring
employees. Marginal revenues and variable products are not economic laws.

can. A trade deficit exists when a nation's imports are greater than its exports. A trade surplus exists
when a nation's exports are greater than its imports.

understood in the same way by both the speaker and the listener. Persuasion is an important part of
communication and is something you do almost every time you talk to someone. You want others to
understand your message and agree with you. During the process of persuading, you usually try to
motivate others to take some kind of action. Education involves learning. Self-control is restraint of your

Become bored with the work. Burnout is a type of exhaustion that is usually caused by too much stress.
Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension. Burnout can occur when
employees perform the same tasks over and over again, which causes them to become bored. Ongoing
boredom can create a certain type of stress and burnout in some individuals, especially those who thrive
on variety and activity. Receiving new work assignments and interacting with coworkers often relieve
boredom. Receiving (positive) feedback from managers often motivates employees to improve or
continue producing quality work rather than causing them to experience burnout.

Transfer payment. Income is money received from outside sources. Sources of income include salaries,
interest earned, dividends, rent, and transfer payments. Transfer payments are monies paid by the
government in which no goods or services are received in exchange, such as welfare benefits, veterans'
benefits, disaster aid, and unemployment. To receive transfer payments, individuals, businesses, or
jurisdictions must meet certain criteria. A rebate is a return of part of the price a customer pays for a
product, usually from the product's manufacturer. A refund is a sum of money given back to individuals or
businesses. Refunds are issued when an excessive amount has been paid (e.g., tax refund) or when
items have been returned to a business. Wage garnishments are court-ordered initiatives that involve
taking income taken from an employee's salary and submitting it to another person or organization.
Examples of garnishments include child support and alimony.

Add to the cost of the purchase. Using credit can add to the total cost of goods and services. For
example, interest, or finance, charges are added to accounts that are not paid in full at the end of each
payment period. When customers buy products with a credit card, they often pay over a period of time.
Then, each month they pay interest on the unpaid balance. The interest charges add to the cost of the
purchase. Interest charges do not increase the retail price because customers who pay in cash are not
charged interest. Interest usually is calculated monthly rather than yearly. Interest generates profit for the
credit-card company rather than the store.

Health insurance. Payroll deductions are monies that an employer withholds from an employee's gross

government on behalf of the employee. Other deductions might include health insurance premiums,
voluntary savings, and child-support payments. Net pay is the amount the employee receives in his/her
paycheck after the deductions have been subtracted from the gross earnings. Gross earnings are income
before deductions. Overtime hours are the number of hours an employee works over his/her regular
schedule. Pay rate is the amount of pay a worker earns at a set interval (e.g., an hour).

The product is expensive. Because money is a limited resource, customers tend to spend more time

Individuals tend to spend more time evaluating options when buying homes, cars, and computers.
Businesses tend to spend more time evaluating items such as operating equipment and contract services
(e.g., ad agencies and tech support) before making a decision. Customers are less likely to spend a lot of
time evaluating perishable items (e.g., food) or things that they need immediately (emergency health
care). If a customer has a high level of loyalty to a specific brand, then the customer will spend less time
evaluating competitors' products before making a decision to buy.

Internal and external. The environmental factors that businesses consider when conducting a situational

an impact on the business's marketing effort, such as the distribution system or the pricing strategy.
External factors are those that exist outside the business and over which the business may have no
control, such as the state of the economy or the number of competitors. Businesses examine both types
of environmental factors in order to adapt to change and make effective marketing decisions. For
example, a business might decide to adjust its prices to remain competitive if the economy is slowing
down. Physical and personal, ethical and legal, and formal and informal are not types of environmental
factors that businesses consider when conducting a situational analysis.

Groupware computer. Groupware computer software allows employees to share and access the same
information from a variety of locations. The ability to access the same information allows each employee
to have the necessary data to complete his/her portion of the project in a timely manner. Using
groupware computer applications can increase productivity and efficiency. Businesspeople use
presentation software to develop computer-operated visual aids that support an oral presentation.
Spreadsheet software programs are designed to organize, calculate, and analyze mathematical or
numerical information. Data mining is the process of searching computer databases to look for patterns
and relationships among information.

Types of products being purchased. Businesses maintain a variety of records about the quantities and
types of products that customers are purchasing. These records are usually known as sales records. By
analyzing past sales records, businesses can determine what customers are buying, when they are
buying, and how much they are buying. This helps a business forecast future sales so it can be prepared
to offer the products that customers want. Businesses do not maintain customer sales records that
contain information about the discounts offered by manufacturers, the cost of paying commissioned
salespeople, or the suppliers that provide the goods.

any illegal entry into a building to commit a theft; and pilferage, theft of small sums of money or

Prepare a report. When a project has been successfully completed, it's a good idea to have a final
meeting. Group members often will have suggestions for improvement that the manager can include in a
report. Managers usually prepare some type of brief report that explains the project, what worked, and
what didn't work. This is particularly helpful if the project is one that will be completed again. The
information in the report will make next year's project much easier to plan and manage. In many cases,
there is no front office to close. Managers do not actually give up power or authority. The project they
were in charge of is simply over. After the project has been completed, managers often obtain feedback
from the group to include in a report.

with the project. The team members also discuss how processes could have been improved. The
information obtained from the “lessons learned” meeting is summarized in a “lessons learned” document,
which can be used by teams that execute similar projects for the organization in the future. The project's
purpose and the stakeholders' expectations are explained during the initiation phase of the project. The
allocation of resources is determined during the planning phase of the project.

marketing factors are not equivalent or the same.

Consumers have fewer choices. Predatory pricing is the practice of pricing goods extremely low with the
goal of driving the competition out of business. If a company forces its competitors out of business,
consumers have fewer items from which to choose or fewer places to purchase goods. Predatory pricing
practices might leave fewer choices for consumers, but they do not necessarily lead to higher property
taxes. Small companies are often the businesses that are most affected by predatory pricing.

mass customization which allows businesses to produce customized products for one customer or only a

many customers by making variations of one product. Automatic production, computerized robotics, and
intermittent conversion are not methods that allow businesses to produce products that are specialized
for a very few customers.

Using tamper-resistant packaging. Many businesses produce products that might be harmful to
consumers if the products are tampered with or become contaminated. To protect consumers,
businesses often use tamper-resistant packaging which makes it extremely difficult for someone to get to
the product without damaging the packaging. As a result, customers are able to easily determine if this
type of packaging has been tampered with, which warns them not to buy the products. Using tamperresistant
packaging is an ethical procedure that businesses follow in an effort to protect their products
and ensure the safety of their customers. Products usually are not wrapped in plain paper. Placing
informative commercials on television and explaining the new manufacturing process are not ways of
protecting consumers.

Product opportunities. A product opportunity occurs when a favorable circumstance to market a product
exists. Entrepreneurs uncover these circumstances by being attentive, watching trends, and pinpointing

reasons for taking a certain course of action.

Precautions when using the product. Labels for nonhazardous products should list all ingredients, any
additives or preservatives the product contains, fiber content, acceptable uses, unacceptable uses, or
proper circumstances for use. On the other hand, producers of hazardous products can use the product
label to warn consumers of any dangers involved in using the product and tell them what precautions to
take. For example, the makers of a drain cleaner print a poison "death's head" on the label and tell
consumers how to protect themselves when using the cleaner. All label information should be accurate
and as easy to understand as possible.

Use drugs they do not need. Advertising prescription drugs is often a controversial topic. Those who feel
it is ethical to advertise drugs believe that the ads are simply providing information. Those who feel that
this type of advertising might be unethical believe that it persuades customers to ask their doctors for
drugs they do not need. If customers see ads for certain drugs, they may decide they would like to try
them. Oftentimes, doctors will write prescriptions for patients if they are persistent, even if the doctors
don't think the drugs are necessary. Also, promoting name-brand prescription drugs encourages
customers to ask for them rather than comparable generic drugs that are less expensive. Customers
usually are unable to buy drugs they cannot afford. Prescription drugs usually must be purchased from a
licensed pharmacy rather than from the manufacturer. Persuading customers to order inexpensive drugs
is not an ethical issue.

Suburban newspapers. Newspapers are the main advertising media for supermarkets. Suburban
newspapers are intended for audiences within a certain geographic area. These newspapers contain

order to reach a large number of potential customers who live in the area that the chain services. Transit
advertising serves certain city areas and would not reach customers in the chain's entire area. Regional
magazines and national television would reach customers far beyond the chain's geographic area.

Providing information to activists to share with others. Word-of-mouth promotion involves customers who
tell others about their satisfaction with the business. Amplified word-of-mouth promotion involves the use
of proactive efforts (campaigns) in which the business provides specific information to customers
(activists) to pass along to their friends, family, and business contacts. On the other hand, organic wordof-mouth
promotion occurs naturally. Because customers are satisfied with the business and its products,
they tell others about this satisfaction in the course of normal conversation. For example, if a business
shows a sincere interest in the customer by asking for feedback, taking actions to ensure customer
loyalty, or improving products, the customer is likely to share those positive experiences with others.

Newsletters, annual reports, and the company's web site. Public relations involves establishing good
relationships between the business and the public. A business tries to maintain positive relationships with
different groups that make up the public, such as employees, local businesses, government officials, the
media, and the business's shareholders. Because the shareholders are the owners of the company, it is
important to develop and maintain positive relationships with them. The public-relations department does
this by communicating with them through newsletters, annual reports, the company's web site, and online
social networks. Print advertisements and commercials are forms of nonpersonal advertising. Businesses
use press releases and news conferences to convey information to the media. Policy manuals help guide
employees' actions on the job. Consumer blogs can be developed by anyone to communicate positive
and negative information about various goods and services. A sponsorship is a partnership in which a
company pays a fee to affiliate itself with a team, league, or event.

The media. The media are the message channels used by a seller to promote a good, service, or ideas,
e.g., radio, television, newspapers, magazines, Internet, etc. Businesses often use the media to
disseminate positive information about themselves and their employees to external audiences in order to
establish good relations with those audiences. For example, businesses might prepare press releases or
hold press conferences so the media will publicize the information and inform external audiences. A
marketing-research firm conducts marketing research for clients. A creative writer puts the information in
a written format but does not disseminate it. An infomercial is a lengthy commercial that looks like a

Holding product demonstrations. A trade show is an event where businesses communicate information
about products to build sales leads and interest. Trade-show participation is a way for businesses to
communicate with the individuals or businesses most likely to buy the business's products. When a
business's salesperson demonstrates the product, trade-show attendees see the product's attributes and
how it works. In some demonstrations, the show attendees often have an opportunity to try the product
themselves. Businesses send direct mail to their customers' homes and businesses. A billboard is a form
of outdoor advertising. Direct mail and billboards are not the most appropriate ways to communicate at a
trade show. A contest is a sales promotion activity that offers a prize or award. Holding a contest, rather
than developing one, is a good way to draw attendees to a trade-show booth, so the business can
communicate information about its products.

Constantly providing new choices for consumers. There is much competition between businesses, which
leads to increased competition to produce better products. Businesses need to develop new or improved

on the needs of its consumers will enjoy a long-term sales increase. Elimination of a slow-selling product

Selling. Selling policies are general rules established by management to guide the personal selling effort

knowledgeable of their company's selling policies, and are unable to explain them to potential customers.
Salespeople may risk losing a sale if they are unable to explain policies about issues such as credit terms

Smartphone. Smartphones, such as Blackberries and iPhones, are mobile devices that salespeople can
use to make telephone calls, access the Internet, manage contacts, schedule appointments, and send
wireless faxes while calling on customers. Smartphones also contain digital cameras, which are often
useful when salespeople must take photographs of goods or spaces that require customized products.
Because smartphones have many applications and are small enough to fit into a coat pocket,
salespeople no longer need to carry around laptops, personal data assistants, etc. Pagers have
capabilities such as telephone message notification and e-mail, but do not have the same capabilities as
smartphones. A kiosk is a stand-alone structure placed in public places that is designed to provide

Affiliation. By understanding peoples' needs and the factors that motivate them to buy, a salesperson is
in a better position to help his/her customers make appropriate purchasing decisions. Many theories exist
that try to explain peoples' needs and the factors that motivate them to behave in certain ways. The
Acquired Needs Theory places needs into three categories—achievement, power, and affiliation. The
Acquired Needs Theory suggests that one of the three needs tends to be dominant in an individual, and
the dominant needs guide or motivate the person's behavior. A person's self-esteem and her/his desire
for advancement and enrichment are possible factors that affect the individual's level of need for
achievement, power, and affiliation.
