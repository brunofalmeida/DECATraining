A large piece of farm machinery. Exclusive distribution means selling a product through just one
middleman in a geographic area. Marketers use this method when they need to maintain tight control
over a product. This is why exclusive distribution is often used for specialty products that are technical in
nature or require specialized services such as installation or repair. Examples of these products are
airplanes and large machinery. Milk and magazines are examples of convenience products, which
usually use intensive distribution patterns. A silk necktie is an example of a consumer shopping good,
which usually uses a selective distribution pattern.

Manufacturer; wholesaler; retailer; consumer. Many producers of consumer goods cannot afford to offer
small shipments. This channel enables the manufacturer to ship large quantities to the wholesaler, who in
turn breaks the shipment into smaller segments to sell to retailers, who sell to consumers. This reduces
packing and shipping expense to the manufacturer.

substantially reduce competition, it is in violation of federal or state antitrust laws. Exclusive territories are
legal under certain circumstances. Arbitration and contracts are legal.

Communicate clearly. Marketing activities are all tasks and processes for creating, communicating, and
delivering value by providing customers with desired products. Channel members are all of the
businesses and individuals who assist in moving goods and services from the producer to the customer.
For the products to move efficiently through the distribution system, it is important for all channel
members to clearly communicate with each other. For example, if a retailer plans to promote a specific
item on a specific day, it must advise the producer or wholesaler to make sure that the items are
available on the day of the promotion for customers to purchase. For maximum efficiency, channel
members should adopt an interdependent rather than an independent mindset. Sanctions are not always
necessary to coordinate marketing activities. Although most businesses conduct different types of audits
(e.g., financial), not all businesses in a supply chain conduct them for all marketing activities.

Take notes while reading. Employees often are expected to read a wide variety of materials to obtain
information that they can use on the job or to help the company. Some of this material may be complex,
technical, and difficult to understand. To extract relevant information effectively, it is often useful to take
notes while reading. Jotting down key points or summarizing helps employees to focus on the information
and remember it. It may not be possible to ask frequent questions when reading. Outlines are developed
before writing begins. Skimming through chapter titles is not an effective way to extract information.

Active listening. Listening is a communication technique that involves processing and understanding a
verbal message. When people actively listen for understanding, they support and encourage a speaker
who is attempting to deliver a message. Active listening involves paying attention in order to respond to
the speaker. Taking notes and speed reading are not communication techniques. Making comments
might encourage a speaker if the comments are appropriate. However, some comments may discourage
a speaker.

Focus on the message's content. In order to follow directions, the listener must hear the directions
clearly. This requires active listening in which the listener is making an effort to learn by "tuning out" any
distractions in the area, concentrating on what the speaker is saying, and keeping his/her mind alert. The
employee is not expected to give feedback or to evaluate what is being said. S/He would be expected to
ask questions if necessary.

and so while he needs to honestly share bad news, it should be handled with care or else it will eclipse

space than bad news. If a post-script is used, it should contain good news since it will be the last

someone else's idea. You evaluate what you have to say before you say it and avoid all sarcasm. Your

Initialisms. An initialism is an abbreviation for a word—a modern form of shorthand that is commonly
used when writing informal messages, such as e-mail and text messages. Some businesses and
industries use initalisms as part of their organizational culture. Examples of initalisms include FYI (for
your information), 2L8 (too late), and LOL (laugh out loud). Because many people do not use or
understand initialisms, it is best not to use them when writing professional e-mails. A conjunction is a
word that connects two words or phrases (e.g., and, or, but). A modifier is an adjective or adverb. An
antonym is a word that means the opposite of another word (e.g., hot, cold).

Repeat business. A business needs to maintain a positive relationship with customers in order to attract
repeat business. Customers who encounter discourteous treatment by employees often do not return.
The loss of repeat business is very costly because it is more expensive to attract new customers than to
keep existing ones. Also, customers who are poorly treated usually tell others. As a result, many potential
customers may decide not to do business with the company. Customers who are treated discourteously
by employees often complain about the business, develop a negative impression of the business, and
experience service problems.

Disagreeable. Disagreeable customers often complain. These customers are unpleasant and hard to
help because they are also argumentative, irritable or moody, insulting, impatient, and may have a leaveme-alone
attitude. Suspicious customers question everything and may want facts and proof before being
convinced that something is true. Slow/Methodical customers require a lot of time to make a purchase
because of shyness or difficulty in making a choice or buying decision. Domineering/Superior customers
are overly self-confident and feel that they know more and are better than the average person.

Listen to Karl and see the problem through his eyes. The first step in providing customer service is to
forget any other concern and focus on the customer's problem. The customer should be listened to as
long as necessary to understand the problem. To state the company's policy about carpet installation or
to put the customer on hold does not allow the service provider to understand the problem. Alternatives
to the problem will be developed, but only after the problem is understood.

Manufacturer. A manufacturer is a type of producer that changes the shapes or forms of materials so that
they will be useful to consumers. For example, a manufacturer that purchases cotton from a farmer
makes fabric. The manufacturer then sells the fabric to apparel manufacturers to make clothes or to other
businesses that sell fabrics to consumers. A trade industry is a business that buys and sells goods to
others, such as retailers who sell to consumers and wholesalers who sell to retailers. A mining business
is an example of a raw-goods producer, which provides goods in their natural state, such as coal.

Number of subordinates. A business depends on its managers to coordinate resources to accomplish its
goals. An aspect of the management function is control, which monitors the work effort. The manager's
span of control refers to the range of employees who report to the manager. Each manager's span of
control can vary due to the number of employees who directly report to him/her. For example, a
marketing manager may have five employees to oversee, while the accounting manager may have one
employee to monitor. Depending on the way the business is organized, some management positions
may be affected by the business's products, distribution channels, or funding, but the number of
employees who report to the manager has a direct impact on the manager's span of control.

Market. In a market system, consumers control the allocation of resources and production according to
what they are willing to buy. Government controls the allocation of resources and the means of

production and the allocation of resources in a socialist command system.

businesses that offer similar types of goods or services. The installation of the conveyor belt would

Gross domestic product. This is the final market value of the total output of all goods and services
produced within a country's geographic boundaries during a year's time. When the unemployment rate is
high, a lot of people are out of work. As a result, production decreases because workers are not working
and producing goods and services. When production decreases, the gross domestic product also
decreases. A high rate of unemployment does not have an impact on the equilibrium price level, personal
income tax, or terms of trade.

thoughts, feelings, ideas, and opinions, but in a way that does not offend or threaten others. If you try to
force your ideas on others, you are stepping over the line from assertiveness to aggressiveness. You

Attorneys. Certain types of financial services often require the assistance of attorneys. For example, most
people hire attorneys to help them prepare their wills to make sure that their assets are distributed
properly. Also, some people set up guardianships to manage assets for minor children. Attorneys usually
provide these types of financial services because wills and guardianship papers are legal documents. To
protect the assets, it is important that these documents be prepared correctly. Executors are the
individuals who carry out the terms of the will. Wills and guardianship papers often are filed with the
appropriate court. Beneficiaries are the heirs.

To develop new products. Businesses need to obtain and analyze a wide variety of marketing information
in order to make decisions for the future. One way that businesses use this information is to develop new
products and improve existing products in order to satisfy customers' needs. In order to make marketing
decisions that will keep them competitive, businesses are constantly gathering information about
customers' preferences and why customers buy certain products. Businesses do not use marketing
information to prepare sales invoices. Businesses obtain marketing information in order to monitor
economic trends, but they are not able to change those trends. Credit scoring is a function of finance that
helps a company determine a customer's credit worthiness.

Remote locations. The Internet is the interconnection of thousands of computers and computer networks

locations, and communicate with others throughout the world. Marketing-information managers often use
the search capabilities of the Internet to look for data that they otherwise would not be able to access
because it is available in remote locations. Most businesses store their sales records in a secure location;
therefore, a marketing manager would not be able to easily access a competitor's sales records through
the Internet. A CD-ROM catalog is a catalog available on a read-only computer disk. A modem is an
internal or external computer communications device that is used to transmit information over a particular

Experiments. Causal research is a type of marketing research that focuses on cause and effect and tests
“what if” theories. Causal research involves conducting experiments, which involves manipulating one or
more independent variables and examining the outcome. For example, a business may test different
types of product packaging in the marketplace to determine how or if the packaging affects sales.

Sample. Descriptive statistics are information that is presented in numerical form and is related to a
specific issue, situation, or concern. Marketing researchers often collect this type of information by
surveying a sample group—a representative group of the target market. After collecting the information,
marketing researchers assign numerical values to survey responses and compile the responses into
descriptive statistics, which help the researchers summarize the information for analysis. The descriptive
statistics should provide the researchers with objective information rather than subjective data. Synectics
refer to a creative-thinking technique that businesses often use for product development. Descriptive
statistics do not summarize solitary data.

participants when evaluating the design of questionnaires.

Locating the publication date. When marketers obtain secondary data, or information that has been
collected for reasons other than the purpose at hand, they must make sure the information is up-to-date
and relevant. Some marketers obtain information from online journals and articles. To make sure the
information is up-to-date or current according to the research standards, the marketer should look for the
article's publication date, which is often included near the author's byline or at the end of the article. A
marketer may not be able to determine an article's timeliness by accessing the web-site's FAQ page,
asking the company's team leader, or requesting a quotation.

Offering a variety of goods and services. Because marketing businesses must compete to attract
customers, they offer a variety of goods or services in many styles, models, colors, and sizes. This gives
consumers many items and price ranges from which to choose. It also increases the number of products
that are offered and helps to maintain reasonable prices. The most immediate impact of the marketing

considerations in getting the selected product in the right place at the right time. Promotion refers to the
various types of communications that marketers use to inform, persuade, or remind customers of their
products. The price element requires marketers to determine the amount of money they will ask in

Factual basis. The primary advantage of quantitative sales forecasting methods as compared with
qualitative forecasting methods is that they provide more exact data, because quantitative forecasting is
based on facts rather than on opinion. The costs, however, are usually higher because the business will
need to pay people to conduct surveys, to purchase the results of outside surveys, to subscribe to
various publications, or to buy computer systems to assemble and analyze the data. Although a variety of
resources can be used as sources of information, the data are based on facts rather than opinions.
Individuals often experience more difficulty understanding numerical data than understanding others'
opinions.

$304,988.25. Spreadsheet software programs are designed to organize, calculate, and analyze
mathematical or numerical information. Businesses often use spreadsheet programs to calculate
projected increases in sales and operating expenses. In this situation, the business expects increases in
sales as well as operating expenses next year. To calculate next year's operating expenses, first
determine next year's sales by multiplying this year's sales by the expected increase and adding that
figure to the current sales figure ($675,500 x 5% or .05 = $33,775; $675,500 + $33,775 = $709,275). To
determine next year's operating expenses, add the current rate to the rate of increase and multiply that
figure by next year's sales (40% + 3% = 43%; $709,275 x 43% or .43 = $304,988.25).

Data are specific to the company. Internal data are available within the business, such as in purchase

specific to the company and reflects how the company operates. The advantage of reviewing specific
data is that the information pertains to the company and can be used to solve specific problems. For
example, inventory reports will indicate if certain products are selling well or if the business needs to
make adjustments. This is not the type of information that the business can obtain by reviewing external
data. Statistics are not necessarily expensive to compile. Employees often have unlimited access to a
variety of company information. Research techniques are not necessarily complex. In fact, some are very
simple.

Unless they are properly trained, employees should not perform maintenance activities on machinery. If
the machinery is not handled appropriately, employees could be seriously injured and the machinery
could be damaged. If some of the employees' responsibilities are to operate the machinery, then the
supervisors' jobs should ensure that employees operate the machinery properly, rather than operate it
themselves.

Checking the customer's signature. Employees should be trained to compare the signature that appears
on the credit card with the customer's signature on the sales check. This is done to verify that the person
making the credit purchase is the rightful owner of the credit card. The use of security personnel and
closed-circuit TV are precautionary measures against shoplifting and employee theft. Buzzer systems
may be used to summon help during a robbery.

Coordinating all of the parts of the project. Benefits of project planning include coordination of all of the
parts of the project, direction for making decisions and for keeping yourself on track, a standard for
completion, clarification of misunderstandings, and motivation. Asking yourself important questions and
setting an appropriate time frame are things you might do while you're planning, but they are not benefits.

Communicate his/her feedback to the vendor. If an auto-parts buyer evaluates a vendor's performance
and determines that the vendor is weak in certain areas, such as keeping promises or staying on
schedule, one of the first things that the buyer should do is communicate her/his feedback to the vendor.
The buyer should let the vendor know what its perceived strengths and weaknesses are, and the buyer
should clearly state what the vendor needs to do to improve and keep the buyer's business. Unless a
vendor's service is completely unsatisfactory, it is wise for a buyer to give the vendor a chance to change
its ways before replacing the vendor with a more reliable one, demanding a refund, or informing others of
the vendor's faults.

Operating expenses. Operating expenses are the expenditures necessary to keep the business running.
Gross profit does not take into consideration these types of expenses. Therefore, a business must deduct
operating expenses from gross profit in order to arrive at net profit. Cost of goods is the amount of money
a business pays for the products it sells or for the raw materials from which it produces goods to sell.
Quantity discounts are deductions from the seller's price for purchasing large volumes of goods. Product
rebates are returning part of the price customers pay for goods.

Create a favorable impression. The overall impression customers receive as a result of a business's
appearance and the condition of its equipment influences their buying behavior. Therefore, ongoing
maintenance is important to properly maintain the facility and the equipment to create a good impression.
The business should be kept neat and clean, but that is a housekeeping function, not maintenance.
Packaging protects products, and a good display presents them effectively.

Set realistic goals. Your goals should be ambitious; however, if you set them too high, you will experience
unnecessary frustration. Take advantage of all available resources to help you reach your goals. Vague,
general goals are useless, as they do not give very much guidance for changing behavior. Only when the
end results are positive will you be motivated to work toward a goal for a sustained length of time.

Aptitudes. Aptitudes are natural talents for learning specific skills. Individuals often succeed in
occupations that require the skills that match their natural talents. For example, some people have an
aptitude for working with numbers while others have an aptitude for working with their hands. People who
have an aptitude for working with numbers might be successful in jobs that require those skills such as
accounting or bookkeeping. Values are the principles by which people live. Behavior is the manner in
which people act. Attitudes are the ways a person looks at life.

Listening. It is important for job applicants to listen carefully to what the interviewers are saying and
asking. Failure to pay close attention may result in the applicants' giving incorrect information or not
completely answering the questions. Not listening also may indicate to an interviewer that an applicant is
not interested in the position. Applicants should not read materials while an interviewer is asking
questions. Applicants should wait until the interviewer has completed the question before talking. On
occasion, applicants may write notes about what the interviewer is saying, but they should not let that
interfere with their ability to listen carefully.

Neatness. All résumés should be neatly prepared. Neat résumés make a good first impression on
prospective employers who often form opinions of applicants based on their résumés. A neat résumé
indicates that the person will be careful and thorough on the job. Also, employers are more likely to read
neat résumés than those that are sloppy or contain errors. Résumés should not be creative but should
contain exact information. Résumés should be brief rather than long. They should not be complex but
easy to read and understand.

Meet with potential customers. The purpose of participating in a trade show is to display goods and
services to interested buyers. Businesses have representatives available to meet with potential
customers to answer questions and explain the benefits of the goods and services in the hope of making
sales. Some representatives may clean and stock the area, order replacement materials, or negotiate
with the set-up crew, but those responsibilities are secondary to meeting with customers.

Quality. Quality is the degree of excellence of a good or service. Customers often associate price with
quality: If the price is high, the quality is high; if the price is low, the quality is low. Therefore, businesses
must set prices that reflect the quality of a product. Profit is the monetary reward a business owner
receives for taking the risk involved in investing in a business. Demand is the quantity of a good or
service that buyers are ready to buy at a given price at a particular time. Economy is the system in which
people make and spend their incomes.

Deceptive. Deceptive advertising practices employ techniques that lead a customer to believe that the
product holds greater value than it actually does. For example, a retailer publishes a very low price in a
newspaper advertisement for a specific product. A customer enters the store with the intention of
purchasing the product at that price. However, the customer finds out that certain criteria must be met to
receive the published price. The business used a published price under false pretenses to get customers
into the store. Inequitable, elastic, and compliant are not terms that are widely used to describe
misleading advertising and pricing practices.

Monitor inventory. Product/Service management is a marketing function that involves obtaining,
developing, maintaining, and improving a product or service mix in response to market opportunities. For
some businesses, part of the product/service management function involves the purchase of goods for
resale. Technology, such as Intranet systems and electronic data interchange systems, allow businesses
to monitor their inventory and reorder products in efficient ways. Monitoring inventory helps a business
make sure that enough products are available for sale. The selling function is responsible for obtaining
higher sales volume, which increases a business's revenue. Advertising is a component of a business's
promotion function. Finance is a business function that involves obtaining funds to pay for business
activities such as expansions.

Opportunity recognition. When people recognize that their ideal state is changing, they may recognize
product opportunities that would satisfy customers. With individual development, a person is growing or
changing such that her/his ideal state no longer exists. In this scenario, customers do not need to
purchase related items, and there is no new information identified.

Customer surveys. Businesses generate product ideas so that they can provide customers with the
goods and services that they need and want. One way to find out what customers need and want is to
review customer-satisfaction surveys. By reviewing the surveys, a business might learn about some
unmet needs and wants which, in turn, stimulate product ideas. Sales receipts, status reports, and
employee records probably would not be useful to businesses when generating product ideas.

Guarantee. A guarantee is a promise made by the seller to the consumer that the seller will refund the
consumer's purchase price if the product does not perform as expected. Promising to refund customers'
money if they are not satisfied with the clothing they purchase is an example of a guarantee. Guarantees
are given for both goods and services. However, a warranty usually applies only to goods and is a
promise made by the seller to the consumer that the seller will repair or replace a product that does not
perform as expected. A rebate is a return of part of the price a customer pays for a good or service;
usually offered by the manufacturer. Although stores often explain their guarantee policies, the policy of
providing the refund is not an explanation.

Product liability. Harrison Stroller Company will be held responsible for any injuries the product caused
the children. Product liability refers to the producer's responsibility for any injury that the business's
product may cause. Product deletion involves removing a product from the product line. Instead of
removing the stroller from its product line, Harrison may decide to improve the stroller's safety by making
changes to the product, which may involve issuing a product recall to fix or replace the faulty strollers.
Consumer protection involves all the efforts to safeguard consumers from any kind of injury they might
suffer in the process of purchasing and/or using consumer products. The Consumer Product Safety Act
was passed in 1972. It gave the Consumer Product Safety Commission jurisdiction over the safety of
consumer products.

To increase sales. Expanding the product mix with successful new products or product lines should
increase sales for most companies. Profits should also increase as a result of increased sales. A
business that expands its product mix often increases its costs and liability because more products are
available. Expanding the product mix reduces risks by spreading the risk over a wider area.

Unique characteristics. The company is positioning its product according to unique characteristics
because it is claiming that its product does something that no other product can do. The ink changing
color in light is a feature, but it is a unique characteristic that is not available on other pens. The company
is not positioning according to the quality or price of the pens or their relationship to other products.

A common vision. Corporate branding refers to the combined impressions, images, or experiences
associated with a company or parent entity. While a company may carry a variety of product lines and
products, the company's vision is the same for all aspects of the business. Vision is the future you desire
to create. The vision should create a focus for setting business goals, making decisions, and
implementing strategies and procedures. An example of a vision statement is, "We want to make our
customers' lives easier." The key word is easy, so all of the company's activities should facilitate making
the customers' lives easier—from providing convenience goods to designing easy to understand invoices
or statements. Ethics are considered when developing the company's vi sion, so the business's ethics
should not change. Services are intangible rather than tangible. Most businesses have several touch
points, which are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with customers.

Increased sales. The most direct way that business benefits from the use of promotion is through
increased sales, which provide the opportunity for increased profits. Competition will not necessarily be
decreased by promotion. Promotion also educates consumers about products, but the business doesn't
benefit directly from this unless consumers buy its products. Promotion's increase of job opportunities
benefits the economy.

Materialistic. A person has a materialistic attitude when s/he obsesses about accumulating money and/or
things, which often provides him/her with a feeling of status, importance, or security. Some people think
that advertising and other promotional activities encourage materialistic attitudes because the primary
goal of these efforts is to get people to buy products. Critics argue that ethical issues occur when people
become more concerned about obtaining things than they are about making a positive difference in the
world. Although some people think that promotion encourages uncompromising, resourceful, and
responsive attitudes in society, it is materialism that is most often associated with ethics in a negative
way.

Affirmative disclosure. When a government establishes a regulation that requires businesses to inform

fictitious terms.

Regional magazines. Regional magazines are intended for audiences within a certain geographic area.
Regional publications appeal to customers within their state or province and attract advertisers who want
to reach that specific market. Choosing to advertise in a regional magazine is one way to reach a large
number of potential customers who live in the area that the chain services. Suburban radio stations and
transit advertising serve only certain suburban and city areas and would not reach customers in the
chain's entire area. National television would reach customers far beyond the chain's geographic area.

Discount coupons. Sales promotion involves promotional activities other than advertising, personal

Discount coupons are printed certificates which entitle the holder to a reduced purchase price. Coupons
are a communication channel used in sales promotion because they are a means of providing
information to others. Package labels, newspaper ads, and television commercials are not
communications channels used in sales promotion.

To strengthen the theme. The elements of an advertisement include the headline, copy, illustrations, and
signature. It is important to coordinate these elements to strengthen the theme of the advertisement. All
of the elements should reinforce and promote the theme in order for the advertisement to be effective. It
is not important to coordinate the elements in advertisements to analyze the objective, identify the
message, or locate the audience.

Target audiences. A target audience is a group of consumers who are the most likely prospects for a
good, service, image, or idea. By participating in trade shows, events where businesses display and/or
demonstrate their products to build sales leads and interest, businesses are able to communicate with
their target audiences. As a rule, only those consumers who are interested in the products being
displayed will attend a particular trade show. Businesses do not participate in trade shows as a way of
communicating with their out-of-town employees, investors, or sales staff. In many cases, employees,
such as salespeople, are expected to participate in trade shows.

using when the businesses develop their own promotional plans. Businesses look at competitors' market

business's promotional plan.

Using product demonstrations. Salespeople who determine customer buying motives can then
demonstrate to customers the features and benefits of a product that would appeal to them. This creates
desire for products by showing customers how they will benefit from owning the products. Emphasizing
the high cost of a product might decrease desire because customers cannot afford the price. Making a
good impression on the customer should create a good selling atmosphere, but does not necessarily
create desire for a product. Monitoring the competition should be an ongoing effort that helps the
business to remain competitive.

Positive reputation. When salespeople consistently provide excellent customer service, customers are
satisfied and are likely to purchase again. Customers are also likely to tell friends, relatives, and
colleagues about the business. This word-of-mouth promotion is one way the business can build a
positive reputation and increase its customer base. Excellent service does not always improve product
quality. Higher commissions are positive outcomes for the salesperson rather than the business. When
salespeople provide excellent customer service, the result can provide a business with a competitive
advantage over its competitors rather than a disadvantage.

Obtained from an industry trade show. A lead is the name of an organization or individual that might be

directly through companies. They include current customers of other divisions of a company and leads
generated through advertising, industry trade shows, and telephone and mail solicitations. Leads

Make certain selling activities illegal. A variety of federal antitrust laws exist that are intended to promote
competition among businesses and prevent the formation of monopolies. These laws affect a business's
sales activities because they make certain actions illegal such as price-fixing and price discrimination.
Businesses that violate antitrust laws are subject to severe fines and penalties. Antitrust laws do not
require extensive reporting to government, establish a formal code of ethics, or create a standard for
employee rights.

Ask an available, experienced employee. Experienced employees such as coworkers, supervisors, or
buyers are generally willing to help new employees by sharing product information. This enables the new
salesperson to serve customers more effectively and to give accurate answers to their questions.
Salespeople who tell their customers to contact the manufacturer are not providing good customer
service. New salespeople should not make excuses for their lack of knowledge or try to help customers
without having the right information.
