Exclusive. Exclusive distribution involves selling a product through just one middleman in a geographic
area and allows the manufacturer to maintain tight control over the product. This method is often used
when the products are technical in nature and require specialized knowledge to install and repair.
Intensive distribution involves selling a product through every available wholesaler and retailer in a
geographic area where consumers might look for it. Chewing gum is an example of a product sold
through intensive distribution. Selective distribution involves selling a product (e.g., designer handbags)
through a limited number of wholesalers and retailers in a geographic area. Invasive is not a distribution

Facilitating customer service. It is important for a business to monitor its channel members (e.g.,
vendors) to ensure that things are operating efficiently. Monitoring often involves following up with
channel members to verify inventory levels and shipping dates. By following up with a vendor to ensure
that the products arrive when and where their customers need them, the business is facilitating customer
service. There is not enough information to determine if the retailer is requesting that the vendor give the
order special attention. The retailer is not evaluating sales quotas or negotiating shipping terms.

Producer to retailer to consumer. The distribution channel consists of the path or route that goods or
services take from the producer to the ultimate consumer or industrial user. In the example, the
producers are the individuals who make the quilts, and Kendra is the retailer who sells the quilts to the
consumers—the individuals who use the quilts. Wholesalers are intermediaries who help move goods
between producers and retailers. Agents are intermediaries who assist in the sale and/or promotion of

Radio frequency identification (RFID). A radio frequency identification (RFID) tag is a small computer
chip that is attached to the item. The tag contains product information such as price, style, model
number, etc., and allows channel members to track the item's movements from the time it leaves the
production line to the point of purchase. The tag allows channel members to know where the product is at
all times. Universal product codes are bar-coded tags that are read by a scanner. Supplier performance
index is a method to measure and evaluate a channel member's performance. A global transit mapping
system, universal product codes, and the supplier performance index are not forms of technology that
track a product's movement through the supply chain.

Have the products available to ship. It is important for a business to coordinate its promotional efforts with
its vendors because the products must be in stock and available to sell during an advertised sales event.
A business that is planning to advertise a sale must first make sure the products are in stock. If
customers visit the business to buy products that are not available, they may become irritated with the
business and go elsewhere to buy. A business does not need to communicate inventory needs with its
vendors to ensure that the vendors pay service fees, change their credit terms, or improve their products'
quality.

Offering different products through each channel. Channel conflict can occur when channel members are
competing among themselves for customers. When each channel sells different products, they are not
directly competing among themselves for business. For example, if a guitar manufacturer sells its line of
guitars through authorized distributors and sells accessories for the guitars through online retailers, the
channel members are not competing for the customers because they are selling different products.
Bypassing channel members and selling directly to end users, establishing slotting fees, and requesting
channel members to carry only its brand are actions that tend to create channel conflict rather than
minimize it.

Organize information. Organizing information helps you to communicate your message to your audience

notecards to organize information is that you can move them around and reorganize as needed. When
you have the information in the order that you want it in, you can efficiently write an outline, report,

Personal space preferences. Businesspeople should try to learn as much as they can about a client's
culture, customs, and social values. By understanding and being aware of cultural differences,
businesspeople can adapt their communication styles to make a positive impression on their clients and
not make them feel uncomfortable. The concept of space and proximity differs among cultures. In some
countries (e.g., England), people prefer to maintain distance from others during conversation. In these
countries, maintaining space is a sign of respect for the other person. On the other hand, people from
Latin-American countries (e.g., Venezuela) believe that it is unfriendly to maintain distance and prefer to
stand or sit closely when conversing. The example is not a cultural issue related to punctuality (time),

consumers are not spending their money. The company did not adapt to market changes by managing its

Individuals and businesses are the primary economic decision makers, and the government helps

rather than the government, own or control the means of production. A private enterprise system is
considered a mixed economy because individuals and businesses are the primary economic decision
makers, while the government helps to regulate and control the system. The government's activities
serve to promote a fair competitive buying and selling environment. In a command economic system

Outputs. The law of diminishing returns is an economic principle stating that after a certain point, hiring

resources are finite, which means that there are fixed amounts of resources (e.g., equipment) available to
produce goods and services. Overall productivity reaches its peak when there are a certain number of
employees using all of the available resources to do the work. When there are too many laborers and not
enough fixed resources, resource efficiency and output decreases. The reduction of outputs does not
necessarily affect product quality, order lead time, or product usefulness.

often based on unproven, false, or distorted beliefs and information. In the example, Rick is stereotyping

Test marketing. Test marketing is the process of introducing a new product to a limited market to
determine what its acceptance will be. During the test-marketing process, the business monitors the
product's sales to analyze demand and surveys customers to obtain their opinions about the product. If
the product is not accepted by the test market, the business may make changes to the product and retest
it later, or it may discontinue the product. If the product launch is unsuccessful, the business reduces the
risk of financial loss because the testing is done in a limited market rather than nationwide. Observation
involves gathering data by watching consumers. Surveys involve asking consumers questions to learn

business might distribute a survey or interview customers for feedback. If the marketing-research
feedback indicates that customers are unhappy with service levels, the business can take corrective
action. A business cannot determine why its sales have been declining by increasing advertising or
reaching new markets. Simply monitoring its customers' online shopping behavior will not provide specific

Constant sum. Constant sum is a type of comparative rating scale that requires the respondent to assign
a value (e.g., percentage or points) to the options provided on the questionnaire. For example, the survey
may ask respondents to rate the importance of various factors in relation to one another, such as
characteristics of delivery service including charges, timeliness, invoice accuracy. The respondents
assign a percentage value to each factor on the basis of importance to the respondent in a way that the
total of all of the values added together totals 100%. The Likert scale rates respondents' attitudes or
feelings according to degree. An example is asking participants to respond to questions on a scale of 1 to
5 with 1 indicating strong disagreement and 5 indicating strong agreement. The semantic differential
scale provides seven spaces, which are bounded by descriptive antonyms at each end, such as durable
and fragile. The respondent places an "X" at the point or space on the continuum that best describes
his/her feelings about the object or idea that s/he is rating. Frequency is a type of category scale and

Invoices. An invoice is the formal, printed record of a sale that includes all necessary information about a
sales transaction. The information includes the buyer, the seller, items purchased, amounts, prices,
delivery date, credit, discount terms, etc. Businesses can review their invoices to determine how often the
customers are ordering from the business and the types of products they are purchasing. Meta tags are
HTML codes that display information about web pages. A stock plan is a list of items that a business
needs to purchase for inventory. An income statement is a financial summary that shows how much
money the business has made or has lost over a period of time. Meta tags, stock plans, and income
statements do not indicate how often specific customers place orders with a business.

Point-of-sale scanners. Many businesses use data from their point-of-sale devices (computerized cash
registers) to collect marketing information. Because the point-of-sale scanner records all of the
customers' purchases, a business can use the device to (indirectly) “observe” its customers' purchasing
habits on an ongoing basis. The business can use the data to determine its fast-moving items and its
customers' brand preferences. Comment cards are small, short, preprinted questionnaires. Manual
equipment is too broad a term to specifically address how marketing researchers collect data. Marketing
researchers do not use sound-wave meters to collect information about the types of products that
customers are buying.

Data cleansing. Data cleansing is the process of detecting incorrect or insufficient data. Powerful
computer software programs can quickly detect and flag inconsistencies so the marketing researcher can
investigate the error in further detail or follow established procedures for correcting the issue, which often
involves removing the response from the data field. Laura is not editing answers, manually scanning, or

Respondent-selection. When interviewers survey an inappropriate sample of the population, the
marketing research becomes skewed. For example, an interviewer who is supposed to interview only
18- to 24-year-old males but interviews some 25- to 40-year-old-males, is not conducting the research
appropriately. This type of error is called a respondent-selection error. Deliberate-falsification errors occur
when people provide false information on purpose. These errors often occur when the respondents do
not want to reveal personal information, are bored, or are embarrassed by the question. Respondentinability
errors occur when respondents forget the answer to a question (e.g., What did you have for
lunch last Tuesday?). Data-analysis errors occur during the data-analysis phase rather than the datacollection
phase of the marketing-research process.

Leading. Marketing researchers should avoid the use of leading questions on their questionnaires
because these tend to influence the respondents' answers and create bias, which skews results. An
example of a leading question is, “Don't you agree that teachers should earn more money for all that they
do?” The way that the question is worded is likely to make the respondent feel like s/he is not a
proponent of education and the teaching profession if s/he answers “no.” Structured questions provide
options from which the respondent can chose. Unstructured questions are open-ended questions that
allow respondents to provide qualitative information and in-depth responses. Structured and unstructured
questions are acceptable question formats to use on questionnaires.

Focus group. A focus group is a group that gathers to discuss a specific topic. Businesses often hold
focus groups to obtain marketing information about their goods and services. The advantage of holding a
focus group is that the marketer can obtain a variety of opinions about a topic (new product line) in one
setting. An in-depth personal interview involves a face-to-face discussion between the research
interviewer and a respondent. The marketing-research company would need to schedule several
interviews, often at different times, to obtain the desired feedback. An environment scan involves
collecting information about the environment (e.g., competitors and economic conditions) surrounding the
business. There is not enough information provided about the product to determine if it is a good or a
service; therefore, a service evaluation form may not be the most appropriate marketing-research
method.

Adjust its marketing strategies. Changes in the marketplace require changes in marketing strategy.
Changes such an increase in operating expenses, tighter government regulations, and the entry of new
competitors in the marketplace require that businesses have flexible strategies so it can respond quickly
to those changes. Pricing changes and advertising efforts are often considerations when a new
competitor arrives on the scene. The business is more likely to increase advertising and reduce its prices,
depending on the competitor's marketing and positioning activities. The business should always be
concerned about maintaining safe working conditions, but this consideration does not impact marketing
decisions in relation to its competitors.

Qualitative. A sales forecast is a prediction of future sales over a specific period of time. Businesses use
many tools to forecast sales. Qualitative methods are based on expert opinions and feedback, as well as
personal experience. Asking customers to complete a survey of buyer intentions provides the business
with general feedback about their customers' anticipated buying activities. The information gathered from
this type of survey usually does not provide specific numerical data that the business can obtain from
previous sales reports; however, it does help the business identify and consider customer trends when it
develops its sales forecast. Cooperative, predatory, and exploratory are not types of sales forecasts.

Filing an infringement lawsuit against Lamar. A trademark is symbol, design, or word used by a producer
to identify a good or service. To prevent unauthorized use of the trademark (or a similar trademark), the
trademark owner should register the trademark with the government. If another company (Lamar) uses a
trademark that is similar to one that has been previously registered (Seward), the original owner
(Seward) can file an infringement lawsuit against the company (Lamar) to stop the unauthorized use. And
in some situations, the owner can obtain monetary damages from the unauthorized user. Directly asking
Lamar to pay a fee is not a legal action. Obstruction of justice is a formal charge in which the judicial
system accuses an individual with the crime of withholding critical evidence that can affect the outcome
of a trial. An arrest warrant is an order issued by a judge that instructs law-enforcement officers to bring

Reporting noticeable hazards to management. One way to prevent hazardous conditions is to be aware
of the things that create these types of situations. For example, if an employee notices that an electrical
cord is frayed, s/he should notify the appropriate manager about the problem so the manager can take
steps to have the electrical cord repaired or replaced. If the electrical cord is not repaired or replaced,
someone could be shocked or a fire could start. All employees should perform their daily duties in a
timely manner regardless of hazards that they may encounter. Employees should replenish supplies
(e.g., paper in the copy machine) to be courteous of their coworkers. Toxic waste must be handled in
specific ways; therefore, employees should report this problem to management so it can be removed
safely.

Following security procedures. Businesses establish security procedures to protect their assets—
equipment, products, facilities, money, information, and employees. Businesses need to communicate
these security procedures to employees so the employees know what they need to do to maintain a
secure work environment and reduce the risk of business loss. In the example, an employee saw a
customer shoplifting, so she notified the guard at the front door to prevent the customer from leaving the
store without paying. Madeline carried out the steps that her employer told her to follow if a security issue
occurred. Madeline did not set the alarm, accuse a witness of theft, or reveal confidential information.

There are many qualified sellers. The request for quotation (RFQ) summarizes the details about the
business's needs, bid requirements, and deadlines. After the business obtains the bids, it can assess
each bidder's strengths and weaknesses. The vendors' goal is to win the bid, and the business's goal is
obtain the best price. RFQs are appropriate to use when there are many qualified sellers (vendors) with
similar products and pricing. Businesses often send out RFQs when the dollar or product volume is high
or the product or project is complex. In some situations, the vendors must take a lot of time to develop
their quotations when the request is complex. RFQs are not generally used when product volume is low,
there is a short lead time, or the company has a preferred supplier.

Reducing waste throughout the entire supply chain. Lean operations are often associated with
manufacturing processes but have evolved to include all business functions throughout the supply chain.
Businesses that are lean operations optimize their resources and productivity levels and reduce wasted
resources, including time, materials, money, etc. Lean operations strive to continuously reduce waste
and maximize efficiency. Lean operations may improve the business's image with the public, but that is
not the primary purpose. Eliminating certain jobs is an action that a business may take to reduce waste,
but this action is not what drives the concept of lean operations.

Scanner fraud. Businesses occasionally make honest pricing mistakes. An employee may forget to key in
the sale price of an item or key it incorrectly into the computer system. When this happens the customer
is charged an incorrect amount for the item when it is scanned at the checkout counter. On the other
hand, scanner fraud is a deliberate action that involves overcharging customers, usually for smaller
goods, with the expectation the customer will not notice or fuss about it. This is unethical behavior
because the business is acting in a deceptive, intentional way to pad the business's bottom line.
Predatory pricing is the practice of pricing goods extremely low with the goal of driving the competition
out of business. Retail price maintenance involves producers pressuring retailers to sell goods at the
suggested retail price, which is unethical and, in some jurisdictions, an illegal practice. Price fixing is an
illegal agreement in which businesses agree on prices of their goods or services, resulting in little choice
for customers.

Consumer demand. Optimal pricing software makes calculations using a variety of product and pricing

product costs into the computer program. Based on a business's inputs, the program makes calculations
that recommend prices, product promotions, and sale items. Using the software to make pricing
decisions saves a business time and money because employees do not need to manually calculate the
pricing. Opportunity cost is the benefit that is lost when you decide to use scarce resources for one
purpose rather than for another. Opportunity costs, the income tax rate, and management methods are
factors that optimal pricing software takes into consideration when pricing products.

Maturity. During the maturity phase, sales peak and then slowly start to decline. Because there are more
competitors that market similar products, a business uses advertising to remind customers about its
goods and services. Businesses often make small changes to their products to make them appealing to
the market's evolving needs and wants. This might involve adding new sizes or colors to the existing
product line. During the decline phase, sales drop sharply, and businesses tend to reduce advertising.
Obsolescence, which is the state of being outdated or unfashionable, occurs during the decline phase of
the product's life cycle. At this point, businesses determine whether to continue to offer the product.
Businesses communicate that their products are available during the introduction phase.

is sold to the end user. Consumers feel more confident about using the product when they open the
package and the item is sealed and protected. Governments often require businesses to place clear,
detailed labels on product packages that indicate the ingredients and the proper way to use or administer
the products. Competitive pricing and a disclaimer on the package do not ensure a product's safety.

It often reduces customers' comparison-shopping activities. Product bundling is the practice of putting
together two or more goods/services to create a one-price package, which is less expensive for the
customer than purchasing the products individually. Product bundling provides customers with a greater
sense of value because they are getting more for less. When customers believe that they are getting a
bargain, they are more likely to purchase the bundled package quickly rather than comparison shop for
similar products. This is an advantage to a business providing the bundled products because it is less
likely to lose sales to a competitor. Bundled products do not necessarily reduce a business's need to
follow up with customers, reduce product training activities, or reduce suggestion selling and advertising

Cue. Brand cues provide tangible evidence of a brand. Brand cues create a psychological signal that
generates a desire for a product or prompt individuals to take action to purchase a product. The signals
may involve colors, shapes, symbols, logos etc. McDonald's golden arch is an example of a successful
brand cue. For example, an individual may be driving to work and see the golden arches on the
McDonald's sign. The golden arches represent food. This reminds the individual that s/he is hungry and
may prompt him/her to stop at the restaurant to purchase a breakfast sandwich. The golden arches
combine color and shape to remind people instantaneously that McDonald's provides food, which
satisfies hunger. Brand cues are elements of the brand personality, which is the projection of a brand that
encompasses its values (beliefs) and emotional connections with consumers. Brand preference is the
level of brand loyalty in which customers desire one brand over another but will accept substitutes if the

likely to purchase the company's products. If it doesn't consider the target market's needs and wants, the
target customers may purchase from competitors, which can negatively affect the corporate brand. The
business may consider the target market's needs and wants when it sets short-term goals. When the
business has accomplished its goals, the goals have been achieved. The target market's needs and
wants are not a primary consideration when preparing routine expense reports. Individuals develop
personal budgets, and businesses prepare a variety of company budgets.

Personal selling. Promotional mix is the blend of marketing communications channels (advertising, sales
promotion, personal selling, and publicity) that a business uses to send its messages to customers.
Personal selling uses planned, personalized communication in order to influence purchase decisions and
enhance future business opportunities. Although personal selling is an expensive type of promotion, it is
most effective to use when the product is complex or difficult to explain. Companies train salespeople
about complex or technical products so they can clearly explain the items' features and benefits to
potential customers. Sales promotion consists of promotional activities other than advertising, personal
selling, and publicity that stimulate customer/client purchases. Examples of sales promotion include
premiums, coupons, and free samples. Advertising is a nonpersonal form of promotion that is paid for by
the company. Examples of advertising include television commercials, billboards, and newspaper
advertisements. Publicity is a nonpersonal form of promotion that is not paid for by the company or
individual that benefit from it.

Age stereotypes. A stereotype is a set image or an assumption about a person or thing. Businesses must
be careful to avoid stereotyping people in their advertising because viewers may find it offensive. An
advertisement that portrays a group of elderly people as frail and feeble is reinforcing a stereotype.
Because many senior citizens are embracing active, healthy, and busy lifestyles, the ad does not
represent social norms. Ethnic bias involves unfair or preconceived ideas about an ethnic group or
culture. Puffery is the practice of using exaggerated expressions to describe a product or its features
(e.g., "the best").

Cease-and-desist order. A cease-and-desist order is a court-ordered demand requiring an advertiser to
stop running an advertisement. Affirmative disclosure is a legal remedy in which the government orders
the advertiser to include product information in future advertisements that it omitted in its previous
advertisements. Appropriation refers to the unauthorized use of an individual's name or likeness for
commercial purposes. An indictment is the legal process of formally accusing a person of a crime and
putting that person on trial.

Amplified is planned, and organic is spontaneous. Word-of-mouth promotion involves customers telling
others about their satisfaction with a business and its goods and/or services. Amplified word-of-mouth
promotion involves the use of planned efforts (campaigns) in which the business provides specific
information to customers (activists) to pass along to their friends, family, and business contacts. On the
other hand, organic word-of-mouth promotion occurs naturally. Because customers are satisfied with the
business and its products, they tell others about their satisfaction in the course of normal, interpersonal
conversation. Both forms of word-of-mouth marketing are interactive. Passive behavior is conduct in
which people fail to exercise their own rights and to respect their own needs.

An online bookstore sent a personalized e-mail message that included a coupon to a customer. Direct
marketing involves communicating messages directly to the customers or potential customers who are
most likely to act upon the message content or offer. A form of direct marketing is direct e-mail, which is a
promotional medium that comes to customers' computers. Businesses often use their customers' sales
history to determine what they are most likely to buy and customize promotional messages based on the
customers' preferences. For example, an online bookstore has sales records of the books that a
customer buys. If the customer tends to buy suspense novels, the bookstore can customize their
promotional messages to include coupons and sales information about a specific book genre. A
television ad and a coupon booklet are forms of nonpersonal communication. Although catalogs are often
sent as direct mail to customers, posting the catalog on a web site is a form of nonpersonal
communication.

85. B
Trade advertising and trade shows. Sales promotion encompasses promotional activities other than
advertising, personal selling, and publicity. Depending on their target markets, businesses use different
types of sales-promotion strategies to stimulate sales. When a business uses the “push” sales-promotion
strategy, it is attempting to move or push the product through the distribution channel to the end user. To
do this, businesses use sales-promotion techniques (e.g., discount coupons and rebates) to provide
channel members with incentives to sell the products to their customers, which are often the end users.
Businesses often use trade advertising and trade shows to inform channel members about their products
and sales promotions. If a business uses a pull strategy, it is likely use mass advertising communication
channels (e.g., national television commercials) to reach the target market. Pricing is a marketing
function that involves determining and adjusting prices to maximize returns and to meet customers'
perceptions of value.

Media kit. The public-relations function involves establishing good relationships between the business
and the public. A business tries to maintain positive relationships with different groups that make up the
public, such as employees, shareholders, local businesses, government officials, and the media. It is
important for a business to build positive relationships with the media because they have access to large
groups of people through the airwaves and their publications. Often, a business provides newspaper and
magazine publishers and television and radio stations with media kits that provide information about the
business and its employees. It is the business's goal that the media will air or publish news stories that
portray the business in a favorable way, which provides positive publicity. The public-relations director did
not develop a sponsorship program, creative brief, or advertising profile.

attention in a balanced, visually attractive, and clear way. The advertisement's elements should relate to
one another to convey the ad's theme and reinforce the message. The purpose of an advertisement
determines if it is appropriate to convey humor or entertain the audience. Clear advertisements should

Writing press releases, distributing company newsletters, and sponsoring events. Public relations are a
function of business that is designed to establish good relations between the business and the public.
The business can foster goodwill with its various publics—its customers, its investors, its employees, the
community—using a variety of tools and activities. Some public-relations tools and activities include
writing press releases, distributing company newsletters, sponsoring events, and holding press
conferences. Identifying trends is a marketing-research activity. Hiring new staff members is a humanresources
activity. Product development is a product/service management activity.

Lobbying government officials. The government regulates many types of industries and businesses.
Businesses often want to influence legislation that affects the way they operate. The activities that the
business uses to influence legislators are called lobbying. Lobbying efforts are a public-relations function.
A debate moderator is a neutral third party who guides a discussion about a controversial issue. A publicrelations
audit is an examination of the business's public-relations processes and activities. Coordinating
service projects is not a public-relations activity that businesses use to influence legislation.

Using interactive displays that allow attendees to try the tablet. Participating in a trade show is a way for
a business to communicate with the individuals or businesses most likely to buy the business's products.
Because there are many other exhibitors, a business needs to design a visually attractive space, offer
sales promotions, and display products in an appealing way to encourage attendees to stop at its booth.
When a business's salesperson demonstrates the product, trade-show attendees see the product's
attributes and how it works. In some demonstrations, the show attendees have an opportunity to try the
product (e.g., tablet computer) themselves. The event's staff members are responsible for handing out
the trade-show programs at the facility's entrance. A sign and name badges that depict a photo of the
product are not the most effective ways of drawing attention to a trade-show booth.

Exhibit costs. Trade shows are events where businesses display and/or demonstrate their products to
build sales leads and interest. A business considers many factors when deciding if it should participate in
a particular trade show. There are many costs associated with trade shows including employees' travel
and lodging expenses, exhibit booth rental space, audio/visual rentals and Internet hookups, display
shipping costs, etc. If the number of expected visitors is low and the show takes place in a distant
location, the costs of participation may not be feasible. Primary circulation is the total number of copies of
a newspaper or magazine sold at newsstands or by subscription. A trade-in allowance is a price
reduction offered for selling back an old model of the product being purchased. Pricing strategies are the
tactics that a business uses to convey the value of a product in relation to the amount of money it
charges for the product (e.g., prestige).

Business's promotional objectives. A promotional plan is the framework or blueprint that guides the
business's promotional activities. The activities that a business selects should align with its promotional
objectives, which are the goals that the business hopes to accomplish through its promotional efforts—
advertising, sales promotion, public relations, and personal selling. The executive summary is the section
of the promotional plan that provides an overview of the entire document and is usually the last
component developed for the promotional plan. Channel members and other business activities might be
considerations when setting the business's promotional objectives.

Obtain referrals. A referral is a method of prospecting that involves asking for names of individuals who
might be interested in the business's products. Customers who have had positive service experiences
with the business are more likely to provide the business with referrals. Referrals often lead to more sales
and profits for the business. The business's profit margin depends on many factors, including the type of
product and the business's objectives. Excellent customer service does not always involve providing
rebates or expanding the business's product line.

Guarantee. Selling policies are the general rules established by management to guide the personal
selling effort—they outline how things must be done. Terms-of-sale policies are the guidelines covering
the aspects of the sale with which customers are usually most concerned. A guarantee policy is a type of
terms-of-sale policy that addresses the quality or performance of a product. It's a promise made by the
seller to the buyer that the seller will replace or fix a product if it does not perform as expected. Delivery
policies are guidelines that address product transportation and delivery. Installation policies are service
policies that address issues that involve setting up products so they can be used. Adjustment policies are
service policies that guide the conditions under which businesses implement credit adjustments or cash
reimbursements when their customers return products.

Giving gifts to customers. Some businesses view giving and/or accepting gifts as a form of bribery.
Therefore, it is important for businesses to establish specific gift-giving policies for their salespeople. If a
salesperson does not know if it is appropriate to give a certain type of gift, s/he can refer to the
company's written guidelines about acceptable and unacceptable behavior. In general, expensive gifts
such as vacations are not appropriate. On the other hand, giving or accepting a holiday gift basket may
be an acceptable practice for some businesses. Asking for sales leads, allowing customers to try a
product, and holding sales events are ethical practices.

Global positioning system. Global positioning systems (GPS) make it possible for drivers to determine
their exact location and obtain accurate directions to destinations. Because outside salespeople usually
have established meeting times with their clients, a GPS provides directions and routes that will get them
to their destinations in the shortest amount of time and reduces the risk of getting lost. An electronic data
interchange (EDI) is used to place orders, invoice, or provide shipping information. An electronic data
interchange, an automated personal planner, and business analysis software are not forms of technology
that outside salespeople use to obtain directions to their destinations.

Convenience. Benefits are advantages that consumers receive from using a product. In the example,

customer does not need to clean the oven, s/he has time to do other things. Features are facts or
characteristics of a product, such as appearance, durability, and size.

Product is expensive. Salespeople go through many phases during the selling process. When trying to
close a sale, a salesperson may encounter objections raised by a customer. An objection is a point of
difference between a customer and a salesperson that may prevent the sale. Generally, salespeople
encounter objections when they are selling expensive products such as appliances, cars, and homes.
Because customers tend to spend more time making decisions about high-priced items, they are more
likely to find reasons not to buy. It's the salesperson's job to overcome these objections and help the
customers realize that the items will meet their specific needs. Impulsive customers are less likely to
raise objections because they tend to put little thought into their purchases. While discovering the
customer's needs, the salesperson is determining what product will best satisfy the customer. Because a
specific product has not been presented during the discovery phase, the customer does not have enough
product information to provide a reason not to buy. The salesperson reaffirms the buyer-seller
relationship after the customer has agreed to purchase the product. By that time, the customer's
objections have been addressed.

Patronage. People buy goods and services for many reasons or motives. Patronage motives are reasons
for buying that are based on loyalty to a particular business. Customers often are motivated to buy from a
certain business because of price, quality, or service. Businesses encourage patronage motivation
because loyal customers buy regularly, which helps the business remain competitive in the marketplace.
A testimonial is a statement by an identified user of a product proclaiming the benefits received from the
use of the product. Patrick's buying motive is not based on testimonials, culture, or status.
