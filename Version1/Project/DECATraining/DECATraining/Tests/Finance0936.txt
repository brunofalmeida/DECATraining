When preparing oral presentations, employees need to consider the age, educational level, and interests of the audience in order to include information that will appeal to that specific group of people. Business employees do not identify the audience in order to select a comfortable seating area or to send invitations. One aspect of identifying the audience might include determining the educational level rather than the schools attended.

Title. The inside address section of a business letter should include the addressee's title, which might be both a courtesy title and a job title, if known. A courtesy title such as Mr. or Ms. should always be used and, whenever possible, a job title such as manager or president. A correct inside address with title is as follows: Mr. John Doe, President. The subject, date, and message are not part of the inside address section of a business letter.

Minutes of a staff meeting. Simple written reports are often intended to provide information to the business's employees. An example of a simple written report that a business might prepare on a regular basis is the minutes of a staff meeting. Businesses often have routine staff meetings and prepare a brief summary to distribute to all employees. This serves to remind employees of the topics discussed and provide that information to employees who may have been unable to attend. Results of a research study, findings of a major investigation, and analysis of a publicity campaign are examples of complex written reports.

Ability to interact with customers. In order to provide quality service, employees should be able to interact with customers to determine their wants and needs. The ability to interact is a communication skill because it involves talking to customers, asking questions, and solving problems. Employees cannot provide quality service if they are unable to communicate effectively. Cooperating with coworkers involves teamwork. Employees need knowledge rather than communication skills to perform job functions. Training employees to understand business operations does not necessarily include or require employee communication skills.

Know the location of products within the business. Knowledge of where products are kept in a business helps employees to provide efficient service to customers who are looking for specific items. Employees can locate products for customers or direct customers to the right location. In a large business, the sales staff cannot be informed about all products that are in stock. It is also unlikely that the sales staff will know why the business does not carry certain products since that is a purchasing decision. Sales personnel should be helpful, but they are not always able to solve customers' problems.

They also should not pressure the customer or speak and act too quickly.

Lower interest rates. When the money supply is loose, there is more money in circulation, which means there is more money available to loan. As a result, it is less expensive to obtain credit because financial institutions charge lower interest rates in order to be competitive. This is a good time for customers to borrow money because they can shop around for the best interest rates. A loose money supply encourages economic growth, which usually results in more investing. The growth is good for businesses and often leads to an increase in employment.

Clear checks. One of the main responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System is to handle the clearing of checks. All checks that are written and deposited pass through the Federal Reserve System. For example, Customer A sends a check to Business B which deposits the check in its bank account. The bank sends the check to its district Federal Reserve Bank which processes the check and transfers the funds from the customer's account to the business's account. The Federal Reserve System does not sell bonds, open accounts, or control savings.

Inflation directly affects interest rates. High rates of inflation drive up the cost of money, ultimately leading to higher mortgage payments or higher monthly car payments. Inflation does impact interest rates, and it does have an impact on the economy as a whole. Inflation is a vital concern in financial planning and, if ignored, can wreak havoc on budgets and financial plans.

Equilibrium. Equilibrium price is also called market-clearing price because that is the effect it would have on the market. However, it is seldom, if ever, the price that exists in the marketplace. Market price is the actual price that prevails in a market at any particular moment. Demand is not a price but the quantity of a good or service that buyers are ready to buy at a given price at a particular time. Break-even is the point at which a business has recovered its costs and begins to make a profit.

Regulate the economy. A monetary policy is the government policy that determines the amount of money that will be in circulation and the level of interest rates. By adjusting interest rates and the money supply, a government is able to regulate the country's economy. For example, increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates usually helps the economy to grow. If a government raises interest rates and reduces the money supply, economic growth usually slows down. A country's monetary policy does not supervise the banking system, issue new currency, or monitor government spending.

Purchasing power decreases. When the inflation rate is higher than the percent of raise that employees receive, the purchasing power of those employees decreases. This has a negative effect on the economy because the higher inflation rate means higher prices for goods and services. Although the employees received a raise, the raise was not equal to the rate of inflation, so employees actually lost purchasing power. They have more money to spend, but the goods and services they want cost more than their pay increase. The employees' take-home pay increases although it will not buy the same level of goods and services because of the higher inflation rate. When inflation is high, interest rates usually increase. A small rise in inflation will not necessarily affect employment levels.

Prices will continue to rise. When inflation is at a high level, prices are also high. During times of inflation, prices often continue to rise. As a result, some businesses might decide to hold on to products to sell later because they anticipate that prices will continue to increase and they can sell products for more at a later time. Consequently, inflation can cause a decrease in supply because businesses are waiting to sell products at the highest price possible. Businesses do not hold on to products to sell later because taxes will limit production, cash will be in short supply, or income will remain constant.

Resistance can occur at any point in the change process, so you'll need to be ready to address it at any time. Ambiguities are words or phrases with either a double meaning or a doubtful meaning. Compromise is a settlement of differences in which each side makes a concession. Negotiation is the process of one person reaching an agreement with another person to meet specific needs or wants. In many cases, compromise and negotiation are not possible because the change must occur as planned.

Persuade. A manager who has the reputation of being knowledgeable and experienced usually has credibility with employees. Credibility is believability. Managers who are believable usually have the ability to persuade others because others trust them. Also, employees are more likely to believe a manager who has the appropriate background and ability. On the other hand, managers who have a reputation of being unethical or poorly informed often have difficulty persuading employees because the managers lack credibility. Effective managers try to work with employees rather than dominate them. Most managers, regardless of experience, usually have the authority to terminate employees for legitimate reasons. Being knowledgeable and experienced does not necessarily mean that a manager has the ability to analyze employees.

Harmful information. Workplace gossip is often spread through the grapevine, which is an oral communication method in which information is passed around the company but not formally announced or verified. An ethical problem with spreading gossip is that it is often incorrect and becomes exaggerated and distorted as more and more employees communicate the information. This information may be harmful if it reports rumors that are unfounded, such as warning of impending layoffs when none are planned. Workplace gossip usually does not communicate positive feedback, helpful solutions, or illegal messages.

Politely explain the bank's policy. Bank tellers should be prepared to resolve disputes raised by customers. In some cases, these situations are difficult to handle because the customers are at fault. When that occurs, tellers should politely explain the bank's policy and try to help the customer understand. Being polite and courteous is often the best way to handle disputes. In a dispute about an overdraft charge, tellers usually would not refer the customer to the main office or ask a manager to remove the charge unless it was determined that the charge was incorrect. Offering to balance the customer's account will not resolve the dispute.

Capacity to pay. When deciding whether to grant credit to a customer, a business usually analyzes the customer's income and employment status to determine if the customer has the capacity to pay. If the customer has a steady job and sufficient income, businesses probably will consider the customer to be creditworthy because the customer has the ability to repay the debt. Businesses may not grant credit if the customer has been employed for only a short time or has a limited income because these factors affect the capacity to pay. When businesses analyze income and employment status, they are not considering a customer's payment history, level of assets, or social standing.

Installment credit account. This type of credit is used to purchase large, expensive items such as furniture or appliances. Customers know exactly how much is due each month and how long they will be making payments. Revolving credit usually has a credit limit, and there is no set time for payment in full. Secured loans are funds obtained when the borrower pledges to the lender some valuable possession, such as real estate, stocks and bonds, machinery, or the cash value of a life insurance policy. Unsecured loans are funds obtained by simply signing a promissory note to repay the loan. These loans are usually for a short period of time.

Risk is high. Insurance is a contractual agreement in which one company (insurer) will pay for specified losses incurred by the other company (insured) in return for installment payments (premium). The premium amount is dependent on many factors, including the risk, or chance of loss. For example, a business located near a river that frequently floods is more likely to pay higher property insurance premiums than a business that is not located near a body of water. The insurance company is more likely to pay a claim to the business for flood damages because the chance for flooding is higher. To cover the claim, the insurance company will charge the business high premiums for the policy. Low liability, minimal threats, and good security tend to lower premiums.

Borrow funds. A negative cash flow indicates that a business will need to borrow funds or withdraw cash from a bank account in order to continue operations. A negative cash flow means that the business is spending more money than it is taking in each month. A short-term solution to a negative cash flow problem is to borrow funds to cover expenses. Increasing prices might cause customers to buy elsewhere if they do not want to pay more for goods and services. Businesses experiencing periods of negative cash flow often lay off employees rather than hire new ones. Stopping discounts will not eliminate a negative cash flow situation because it might cause customers to buy elsewhere.

38%. Debt ratio is one type of financial ratio that businesses calculate and analyze in order to determine the relationship between debt and assets. The formula for calculating debt ratio is total debt divided by total assets ($325,000 ÷ $850,000 = .382 or 38%). After calculating their debt ratio, businesses usually compare it to the industry average in order to determine if they have more or less debt than the average business in their industry. A business with a lower than average debt ratio has less financial risk than a business with a high debt ratio.

Selling procedures are rules that a business's salespeople follow. Not enough information is provided to determine if the selling procedures have a positive or negative affect in the way a business conducts its selling activities.

Making investments. Successful businesses know that it is necessary to invest for the future even though that often means reduced profits today. Investing on a regular basis builds wealth over a long period of time. Even if the regular investment is small, it will grow and maximize wealth in the future. However, this reduces short-term profit because part of the profit is being used to make investments. Offering discounts, paying taxes, and increasing salaries will not maximize wealth on a long-term basis.

$4,200. Many investors buy shares of stock because financial analysts predict that the stock will significantly increase in price over a short period of time. If this occurs, the investment will provide a substantial return. In this example, stock that sell for $14 a share today is predicted to sell for three times that amount in two years. To determine the value of the shares at that time, multiply the current price by three ($14 x 3 = $42), and the future price by the number of shares ($42 x 100 = $4,200). If the prediction is true, the initial $1,400 investment will be worth $4,200 in two years which is a significant return.

Risk-return tradeoffs. When businesses evaluate the cost of purchasing certain assets in the hope that these assets will have significantly more value in the future, they are assessing whether the risk of investing is worth the expected return. Businesses often take the risk of investing in certain assets because they believe the assets will increase in value. The tradeoff is spending money now in order to have more valuable assets in the future. However, the risk is that the assets will decrease in value and the business will lose money. Cash-flow projections are predictions of whether the cash generated by a business can cover the operating expenses and loan repayments. Profit-margin requirements are the percentage of profit the business wants to make based on income from sales. Short-term objectives are goals that can be achieved in less that a year.

Industry averages. Businesses often analyze a variety of financial information to determine net profit, return on investment, inventory turnover, etc. These figures indicate trends that are important to the business. For example, a business might find that it is not selling inventory as quickly as it should and has too much money tied up in inventory. By comparing this with industry averages, a business can determine inventory turnover in similar businesses. If its turnover is very low compared to the industry average, the business knows it must take steps to correct the problem. Businesses do not conduct a trend analysis to compare their financial ratios with current liabilities, operating standards, or variable expenses.

29.9%. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing a firm's total liabilities by total stockholders' equity. In this case, the debt-to-equity ratio is $5,320,000 divided by $17,767,000 ($5,320,000 ÷ $17,767,000 = 0.299 or 29.9%).

Set up an emergency fund. Businesses often plan to use an excess of cash to set up an emergency fund to cover unexpected costs or take advantage of an investment opportunity. Businesses may place the excess cash in some type of savings account in order to be able to access the funds quickly when needed. When possible, businesses like to have an emergency fund in place because it may prevent the need to borrow money and pay interest. Businesses do not use excess cash to buy more inventory unless they expect to sell that inventory quickly. Issuing a stock dividend involves creating more shares in a business. Businesses do not use excess cash to reduce operating expenses, which usually are fairly constant.

Hiring a credit department is too costly. Factoring (the selling of accounts receivable) can provide small businesses with the services of a credit department—services that might otherwise come at a high price. Since factors often take on buyers' lending risk in addition to checking buyers' credit and lending businesses money, businesses might use a factor when the risk of buyer default is high. Factoring allows funds to be available spontaneously, or in a continuous cycle.  Anyone borrowing money is interested in the prime interest rate; it is not necessarily an aspect of factoring.

$5,000. The FIFO (first-in-first-out) method of inventory management presumes that items obtained first are sold first. Remaining inventory is the inventory most recently obtained. In the example, the two items that sold were obtained for $1,000 each. The two items in remaining inventory, those most recently purchased, cost $5,000.

They are unable to obtain debt financing. Some small business owners may take out home equity loans to obtain additional capital. These loans are easy to obtain because they involve borrowing on the equity in the home. For example, if the market value of a home is $200,000 and the balance on the mortgage is $75,000, there is $125,000 of equity in the house. The owner may be able to borrow part of that amount to obtain capital. Some owners may select this type of funding because they are unable to obtain debt financing because the business is new or the business is not financially sound. A home equity loan loan is secured with the property. Business partners may both take out home equity loans to obtain capital. The amount of capital it generates depends on the equity in the home.

Payback period. When allocating funds among projects/uses, businesses consider the length of time it will take to regain their money, which is known as the payback period. The payback period is calculated by dividing the initial investment by the cash flows generated. Preferred stock is a type of stock holding in which dividends are guaranteed to be paid. A stock split is an event involving renumbering the shares held by stockholders. "Selling phase" is not a term used to describe the length of time it takes to regain the money invested in a project.

Are expected to differ among alternatives. Only future revenues and expenses that differ among alternatives are helpful to a manager making a short-term decision. Knowing what the alternatives have in common does not help make a decision. Past revenue and expense records, either from the most recent budget period or over the entire history of each alternative, are not helpful beyond determining expected revenues and expenses and are, therefore, not relevant to managers making short-term decisions.

Vertical. There are several types of financial analyses that businesses use to evaluate the performance of the business. One of these is vertical analysis which involves listing each item on the income statement as a dollar amount and also as a percentage of another item on the income statement. For example, a business might state each item as a percentage of sales because it is important to know the relationship between expenses and the sales revenue. Stating each item on an income statement as a dollar amount as well as a percentage of sales is not an example of horizontal, ratio, or operating analyses.

Less than $10,000. When determining the present value of money received in the future, the dollar amount of the money is multiplied by the value that corresponds to the available interest rate (also called the discount rate or cost of capital) and number of periods on a present value table. As noted above, the value for 20 years at 10% is .149. The present value of that $50,000 is $7,450 ($50,000 x .149 = $7,450), which is less than $10,000.

11.7%. A bond's current yield is the annual interest payment divided by the current price of the bond. The annual interest payment on a $1,000 bond with a 14% coupon rate is $140. Calculate this amount by multiplying the value of the bond by the coupon rate ($1,000 x 14% or .14 = $140). Then, divide that amount by the current price to determine the current yield of 11.7% ($140 ÷ $1,200 = .11666 or .117 or 11.7%).

8.24%. Annual percentage rate (APR) is calculated with the formula [1 + (I ÷ m)]m - 1, where I equals the stated interest rate and m equals the number of compounding periods per year. In this example, the interest rate is 8% and is compounded four (4) times a year. An investment that pays 8%, compounded quarterly is calculated thus: APR = [1 + (.08 ÷ 4)]4 - 1;= [1+ .02] 4 - 1;= 1.0824 - 1;= .0824 or 8.24%.

Focus on doing only those activities. Giving rewards for performing certain activities is often an effective way to encourage employees to perform those activities. However, some employees might focus on doing only the activities for which they are rewarded rather than doing other activities that are also important. This is particularly true if the reward is in the form of a cash bonus or additional pay. As a result, routine activities may be neglected because employees are focusing on doing the activities that will increase their compensation. The reward system usually stipulates when the reward will be given, such as monthly or quarterly. Employees usually do not look for ways to avoid doing the work for which they will receive rewards. In some cases, the reward is additional compensation; however, employees do not ask for it.

By analyzing this information, businesses are able to plan future sales and obtain the products that will appeal to customers and encourage them to buy. Without this type of information, businesses might have no idea what customers will want to buy in the future, or how much they will be willing to spend. Businesses do not maintain records about what customers are buying and how much they are spending in order to plan an inventory count, offer quality service, or develop a quality environment.

For example, records that indicate that sales are increasing and the company is profitable might encourage the business to decide to expand. Monitoring internal records does not help a business to track the activities of competitors or understand global economic conditions. Businesses do not use internal records to handle employee problems and complaints.

Other deterrents include guards and detectives, concealed closed-circuit televisions, and fitting room staffs and mirrors, but these techniques are not as effective as electronic article surveillance tags.

Making personal use of company property. Employees can help to reduce expenses by respecting company property. One way that employees can do this is by not taking anything belonging to the business for their personal use. This can range from not making personal use of company vehicles to not taking home pens and pencils. Businesses must replace the company property that employees take for their own use, which results in additional expense for the business. Taking the initiative to find work, reporting incidents of shoplifting, and giving appropriate discounts to customers are ways that employees can help to control expenses.

$460. Many businesses control expenses by hiring part-time employees at an hourly rate instead of salaried, full-time employees. The advantage to the business is the same number of employees working during a given time period but for less wages. To calculate the savings, first determine the weekly payroll expense for one part-time employee by multiplying the number of hours worked each week by the hourly rate ($11.50 x 20 =$230). Then, multiply that amount by the four part-time employees ($230 x 4 = $920); and the total weekly amount by the two-week pay period ($920 x 2 = $1,840). Next, determine what the payroll would be for two full-time employees by multiplying the weekly salary by the number of employees and that amount by the two-week pay period ($575 x 2 = $1,150; $1,150 x 2 = $2,300). Then, subtract the two-week, part-time payroll from the two-week, full-time payroll to determine the amount the business will save ($2,300 - $1,840 = $460).

Accounting. Accounting is the process of keeping and interpreting financial records. In order to effectively manage its finances, or money, a business needs to maintain financial information. Without an effective accounting system, a business might not know how it is doing financially. Therefore, businesses rely on the accounting process to track their finances. Bookkeeping is the step in the accounting process that actually records the business's financial information. Banking involves completing transactions with a bank such as making deposits. Investing involves putting funds into stocks, bonds, etc.

In this example, a customer is making a large withdrawal from a savings account. This might indicate that the customer plans to make a large purchase such as an automobile. An alert teller might recommend that the customer consider taking advantage of the bank's loan services rather than withdrawing money from savings. This will meet the customer's need to buy an automobile without having an impact on the customer's savings. When making a large withdrawal from a savings account, customers do not need insurance or trust services. Banks do not sell lending orders.
